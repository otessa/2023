Work done with open textbook creators at UCT has enabled the DOT4D
initiative to articulate models of open textbook production that are
being employed by academics at UCT who are using their open textbooks to
address social (in)justice in the classroom. Building on this background
work, we explore the values and attitudes of the academics who undertake
open textbook production with student co- creators. Student inclusion is
lauded in research as essential for student belonging, but little work
has been done to look for the challenges involved when traditional power
dynamics are disrupted. In this research, we describe a potential nexus
of three complementary components: open textbooks, social justice, and
students as partners. We investigate the affordances of the open
textbook to facilitate change in the power dynamics of content
production as well as in classroom practice.

<b>Abstract</b>

<p>
<p>
Drawing on experiences of over 20 years in higher education
technology, working across commercial and open technology contexts, this
talk proposes that the procurement of educational technologies is
fundamentally flawed both as a practice and as a process. Institutional
processes such as procurement tend to be absent from conversations about
digital education, often acknowledged as problematic but also outside
our sphere of influence or domain of expertise. On the basis that
pedagogy and technology are entangled in complex ways, in fact the
opposite should be true. The educational technologies we use are not
tools, and should be treated as matters of quality when we consider what
good digital education might look like, and what we think the purpose of
education is.
</p>
<p>
Consideration of ethics are often absent from procurement of
technology, largely based on instrumentalist assumptions about the
neutrality of technologies. Public sector procurement “best practice”
also forces us to use poor proxies for our educational values, purposes,
and contexts, and creates new risks and liabilities for institutions, at
the same time as it seeks to minimise others. Whilst this talk will
explore potential solutions to current procurement process and practice,
the question that remains outstanding is whether we are simply buying
and/or using too much educational technology, and whether, in order to
achieve more environmentally sustainable and just forms of education, we
should be embracing a de-growth approach to educational technology more
generally? How much procurement of edtech, however well executed, is too
much?

Join Dr. Nicole Johnson, Executive Director of the Canadian Digital
Learning Research Association/Association canadienne de recherche sur la
formation en ligne (CDLRA/ACRFL), as she shares how digital learning
trends are changing over time and discusses what this means for the
future of post-secondary education in Canada. Since 2017, the
CDLRA/ACRFL has conducted annual pan-Canadian surveys to track trends
related to digital learning at Canadian post-secondary institutions. In
particular, since 2020, the CDLRA/ACRFL has been investigating the
ongoing impact of the pandemic on course delivery and teaching
practices. Through her independent research and consulting practice,
Dr. Johnson has also worked on multiple other studies related to faculty
experiences with technology, categorizing learning experiences by
modality, and the future of higher education. In this presentation,
Dr. Johnson will discuss challenges faced by institutions (and the
post-secondary sector as a whole), what the future might hold, and
recommendations for the sector.

<p>
One of the most significant impacts of the COVID pandemic on
post-secondary teaching and learning experiences was student
disengagement. While gamification was a strategy that was occasionally
used in junior-level anatomy and physiology courses pre-pandemic, it
became an increasingly important pedagogical strategy during emergency
remote teaching for students to become invested in their learning.
Escape rooms, which are immersive storytelling games, are one form of
gamification. Educational escape rooms, which can be adapted to be
in-person or virtual, incorporate learning objectives into individual or
team-based games, puzzles and clues, and require students to demonstrate
mastery of the material to progress through the storyline. This type of
activity not only helps to increase student engagement, but also
provides an opportunity to develop soft skills like creativity,
teamwork, decision-making, critical thinking and communication that are
important in health professionals.

Using Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel’s landmark essay “A Guide

presentation asks participants to apply the same kinds of critiques
applied effectively to Turnitin in that piece to Course Hero as we
evaluate its claims against the benchmarks of ethical educational
technologies. This experiment in collective meaning-making provides a
model for critiquing tools that have been carefully marketed but not
well-studied by academics, offering a “way in” to these discussions that
is rooted in the practical and factual, and not so profoundly shaped by
personalities of influence.

What is Open Pedagogy? Open Pedagogy (OP) is a process, a way of
thinking and a way of acting. OP is not a collection of pedagogical
procedures. It does not have a set of predetermined outcomes. OP is
intentionally inclusive, intentionally ethical, and reflective practice.
In this workshop we will look at the implications of “open” in a college
setting. How to engage in Open Pedagogy in a STEM college course? We
will have a look at the Physics for Health course: its design, teaching
strategies, and OER that support OP. We will discuss what does it mean
in practice to participate in OP and what opportunities it presents to
support diverse learners and what challenges such practice presents for
an educator. The following questions will guide the workshop:<br />
- How can Open Educational Resources extend into Open Pedagogy?<br />
- How similar and different Open Pedagogy and Inclusive Pedagogy
are?<br />
- How can Open Pedagogy impact accessibility and inclusion?<br />
- What is the teacher’s role in Open Pedagogy?<br />
- What role does technology play in Open Pedagogy?

<p>
The various practices of “ungrading” have gained increasing
popularity, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Ungrading – or
what we prefer to call alt-grading – can increase intrinsic motivation,
alleviate anxiety associated with judgment, and can invite students to
take intellectual risks without fear of being punished or suffering
long-term effects if an academic experiment does not work. The many
benefits of alternative grading include some degree of freedom from such
stress and fear. However, most university administrations resist
revisions to traditional grading, and as such, precarious faculty with
their students’ best interests at heart often struggle to implement
creative, helpful strategies to release students from the stressful grip
of judgment and grades. Further, some ungrading “purists” (particularly
on social media) are unwelcoming to educators who must or would like to
include some fundamental parts of ungrading but must still “fit” within
the constraints of the traditional university grading system. This
interactive, helpful, and friendly session will be a candid look at what
alternative grading really is, what it could be, and how innovative
educators seeking to work within a traditional system can address how to
move forward with alternatives that are legitimate “upgrades” to
“ungrading.”

This session will outline the development of a youth sexual health
education program adapted from a series of facilitated in-person
workshops to a self-guided, asynchronous online format. The development
focused on three key considerations: (1) accessibility, which includes
addressing different learning and physical abilities, as well as
technical elements relating to devices and rural internet networks; (2)
privacy, which includes protection of student information, questions
relating to cross-border data hosting, and the ability of participants
to ask questions and receive support anonymously; and (3) mediation,
which includes how the design of the course must compensate for the loss
of an in-person facilitator. The course modules have focused on the use
of narrative as a strategy for introducing concepts, connecting to
real-world scenarios, and promoting empathy and engagement in the
absence of a facilitator. The session will discuss how choices of tools
and technologies have addressed the program’s stated considerations, as
well as allowed for innovative use of character and storytelling to
promote sexual health education.

This presentation overviews and discusses an on-going peer support
method launched by a Finnish university for their teaching staff. The
aim of the peer support method is to further develop the pedagogical and
digital skills adopted during the Covid19 pandemic. Moreover, its aim is
to re-imagine higher education by promoting best practices of online
learning and teaching based on staff experiences and relevant research.
The university recruited a team of five experienced lecturers from
within its four faculties and the Language Centre to work as pedagogical
support to their peers at a 50% work-time allocation, the other 50% of
their work still consisting of teaching. The team recently finished its
first two-year operation period and has analysed and reported the
successes and challenges of the first two years, with recommendations
for the following two years.
</p>
<p>
The team’s analysis of the first two-year period indicates that this
peer support mode has proven a necessary modus operandi. In an
institution of higher education with its multiple departments, units,
boards, working groups, committees, support services, and digital
services, the voice of a single teacher may too easily go unheard.
</p>
<p>
In its reflexive analysis of the first two years of operation, the
team highlights four areas of success. Alongside with the successes,
challenges do remain, and must be addressed in the following two years
of operation. The main challenges are directly connected to the
successes. The core challenge concerns the need to keep improving
university-wide, accessible, and efficient communication of all the
services and support that are available to the teaching staff.

During the peak of the pandemic, where emergency remote learning was
required, undergraduate students trying to complete a business degree
had a choice between business capstone and practicum. Unfortunately for
our students, there were nearly no positions available as businesses had
decreased their workforce numbers so substantially and were canceling
practicum positions. This created a very large influx of students
through the capstone pathway. This 6-credit hour course is a culmination
of student learning throughout the degree and is the final experience
prior to graduation. A growing number of industry and scholarly reports
explore the disconnect between graduate capabilities and employer
expectations regarding workplace skill competencies (Lapointe &amp;
Turner, 2020; Mishra et al., 2019; RBC, 2019). Highlighted through
consecutive semesters of capstone through 2020 to 2022, an opportunity
arose to scaffold a professional development module into the learning
design. The author will present the structure, purpose, implementation,
and challenges of the module and provide initial insights of the value
and iteration through this time period. The content of the module will
be shared as it leans into open and accessible training and development.
A discussion of the current state and collaboratively brainstorming
options next iteration will be undertaken.

This presentation supports the view that Open Educational Resources
(OER) have positive impact on pedagogy and student engagement. OER
supporters believe that OERs offer compelling implications on pedagogy
including increasing level of student engagement and pedagogical
innovation (Open Education Quality Initiatives, 2011 and Orr et al.,
2015). A community college faculty member and administrator who
supported the faculty member with the Open Educational Resources (OER)
project will share how creation and adaptation of OER in the course lead
to positive impact on student engagement. OER enabled pedagogy assures
student engagement as well increases self-regulated motivation (Werth
&amp; Williams, 2021). A notation that the supporting administrator has
noticed is that when the same faculty member designs the OER and then
facilitates the course, the OER is adopted then anecdotally has greater
results then when OER is adopted without creative input or
customization. The administrator wonders that if faculty do not have the
time to evaluate content to the same degree as an OER creator does they
may lose the value of deep connection with content as noted by Skidmore
(2019).

This proposal describes the development of a learning design
framework by an instructional design team in an open learning division
of a medium-sized university. The team recognized the need for a
foundation that reflected their values and guiding principles for design
and aimed to build tools that would strengthen collaborative
relationships and create a more inclusive and learner-centered
experience. The framework is intended to be used as a tool for framing
conversations with collaborative teams to ensure the principles of
caring, connection, openness and active learning are considered in our
learning design. In the presentation, we will provide examples of the
framework and its underlying principles and focus on how it can support
collaborations among various teams and stakeholders. The team is still
in the process of building collaborative and practical elements to
support course development and will share both these projects and how
the framework is helping to reframe processes and clarify roles.

Museums, archives, galleries, and libraries have balanced their
responsibility to protect the world’s most important cultural artifacts
with their roles as important pillars of public education. However,
these goals become increasingly at odds with each other if the
institution doesn’t take a deliberately decolonial, and anticolonial,
stance towards curatorial work. Left unexamined, contemporary curatorial
practice still carries the legacies of colonization, which is visible in
the metadata of digitized collections from major institutions like the
British Museum. This presentation outlines the necessary role of
decolonial practice in GLAM-field digitization projects as well as in
the digital tools that make this content available to public audiences.
By centering on the co-developed metadata tools of Curationist, we will
offer not only an introduction to this platform and its uses to digital
art and open education, but also a method of online community
development that centers indigenous data sovereignty, community
engagement, and decolonization practices to rebalance the power dynamic
in collections-based open education.

The health measures imposed in 2020-2021 have led to the development
of distance learning courses in the field of leisure. Be it music, yoga,
cooking, etc., many courses have been offered online. This has been
particularly the case with dance. As distance learning dance classes
were rare before the pandemic, new practices had to be developed. How
have dancers adapted to this change in training mode and what challenges
have they faced in teaching or learning online? In this paper, we
propose to look at the challenges faced by teachers and learners of
recreational dance. To do so, we will rely not only on the literature
published on the subject, but also and especially, on interviews
conducted with 78 professional and amateur dancers living in Quebec and
France. We will highlight the technologies and teaching methods used in
these courses as well as their advantages and limitations according to
the teachers and learners. We will then open a discussion on the
perspectives of online dance courses.

While student isolation was a major issue during the pandemic, a
systematic review of the literature conducted as part of the SSHRC’s
Knowledge Synthesis program allowed us to review the scientific
literature on support aimed at limiting the sense of isolation of
students in distance education (DE). This study was conducted on
scientific papers published between 2012 and 2022 and led to the
examination of 301 articles in French or in English. The analysis of
these publications highlights three main approaches to supporting
distance education students: the approach focused on developing student
autonomy and commitment; the approach focused on the support of a
teacher or mentor; and the approach focused on peer-to-peer interactions
and collaborative work. In this paper, we propose to review each of
these three approaches and to outline the strengths and weaknesses that
researchers have identified. We can then discuss how they can be
addressed to provide DE. Finally, we will conclude with some possible
directions for future research.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in dramatic growth in the use of open
education resources, such as open textbooks, as classes moved online
around the world. This highlighted the importance of evaluating the
creation and adaptation of open textbooks used in online courses. In
reviewing the research literature, I found existing rubrics or
frameworks were outdated and lacked criteria that are important in
today’s digital age. Therefore, I synthesized the evaluation and quality
criteria from 31 articles into a single framework, which online
instructors can consider using as they create or adapt an open textbook.
The criteria include content, accessibility, technology, open licenses,
instructional design, and a new category I termed verification.

<p>
<p>
While distance and online education are not new, the Covid-19
pandemic has highlighted the challenges that students can face with
online learning. These challenges can magnify inequity and increase
resistance to learning. Many educators have used the pandemic as
motivation to reassess their courses but still often overlook seemingly
small aspects that can make a big difference for students. Examples of
these aspects might include mobile compatibility, video length, and
technological requirements. The three panelists are experienced
instructional designers and instructors who have focused on improving
accessibility in online learning in a variety of contexts. They will
share their experiences as both advocates and skeptics on why we need to
take the small things into account to develop courses which facilitate
learning for all students without exhausting instructors who are
experiencing their own barriers and challenges.

This article explores the potential of podcasting as a useful
education technology for promoting agency in preservice teacher
education programs. The authors propose a mixed-methods study to
investigate the impact of co-creating podcasts as a holistic pedagogical
practice. Reporting on the first phase of this research, podcasting
appears to helpfully assess student learning. Additionally, it is a
powerful technology that can mobilize knowledge created by preservice
teachers beyond the classroom. Next stages in the research will
incorporate in-service teachers to provide generative feedback, thereby
creating a Community of Inquiry between podcasters and listeners.

<p>
For K-12 teachers sharing resources is a long established
professional practice and with the affordances of digital technologies
the ability to file share has been amplified. However, there are
technological and copyright implications of sharing curricular teaching
content that requires more support and understanding. Copyright ease and
ethical sharing of curriculum resources is provided by open licenses yet
pre-service and graduate education students currently receive
inconsistent tutelage of these licenses. To fill this niche for
understanding, locating, or creating OER, the website Openteacherab.ca
has been developed. Further support for these students to determine OER
quality is the ISKME curation framework that assists with the selection
and assessment of pre-existing K-12 OER. Looking to Washington State
provides a further example of support for the slow trend toward K-12 OER
sharing and development.

<p>
<p>
The pandemic has forced teachers to adapt with greater flexibility to
meet changing classroom environments and student needs, resulting in a
shift in pedagogy towards promoting more intrinsic motivation and
student autonomy. OTESSA’s theme of “Reckonings and Re-imaginings”
reflects this transition, inviting educators to re-evaluate their
approach. One effective way to achieve this kind of shift is to give
students more freedom and choice in their learning, as supported by the
work of Evans and Boucher (2015). This presentation will outline
practical strategies for promoting more student choice in the classroom,
such as incorporating formative assessment exercises, opening student
work to include OER projects, and tips on changing one’s teaching
mindset. Participants will be encouraged to reflect on opportunities for
making small but meaningful changes to their pedagogy to inspire more
student autonomy.

<p>
<p>
Teaching complex scientific concepts in an engaging manner is
challenging for educators. Animated videos can explain concepts and
engage students by combining audio messages with changing graphics.
Whiteboard animation is a style of animated video where the content
appears to be hand-drawn on a whiteboard and narrated in a storytelling
manner. This technique has the benefits of traditional animations, with
the added ability to combine visual thinking and storytelling.
Whiteboard animations were successfully applied to explain
health-related topics. Creating a successful whiteboard animation
requires paid software, time, and drawing skills. Most whiteboard
animation software is designed for business advertising and does not
provide the graphics gallery needed to explain health science-related
topics.
</p>
<p>
We used traditional PowerPoint and hand-drawn digital images to
create whiteboard animation explaining topics for dental education. The
built-in animations of PowerPoint were used to animate the images and
supporting text.
</p>
<p>
We aim to create a series of whiteboard animations for dental
students. According to Dewey, learning is a social activity resulting
from human interactions. Studies found that avatars, cartoon characters,
dialogues, and simulated real-world settings in animated videos serve an
essential social function in engaging students. We hope the whiteboard
animations will be beneficial for dental students.

Higher educational institutes increasingly focus on incorporating
games and simulations to enhance student engagement. Gamification refers
to using or adopting game mechanics, techniques, and game theory in a
non-game platform, like education. Many health professional education
courses have successfully applied gamification. Online games like Kahoot
are shown to increase student satisfaction and motivation, help students
overcome individual difficulties, and improve collaboration. Gimkit is a
new gaming platform that allows instructors to create quiz games that
students can play live in class. The instantly generated code by the
host allows students to enter live games without having an account or
registration. We have introduced in-class gaming using Gimkit in the
Dentistry and Dental Hygiene program at the University of Alberta. The
effect of playing games on student learning, motivation, engagement, and
satisfaction will be evaluated. We believe in-class gaming will be a
positive incorporation in didactic dental education to enhance student
motivation and engagement.

<b>Abstract</b>

<p>
<p>
Canadian higher education institutions are placing increasing
emphasis on the development of distance education (DE) and online
learning (Bates et al., 2017). Historically, in ADF institutions, the
“traditional” teaching process is split into two phases. In the first
stage, courses are designed by a professor or design team. Thereafter,
student mentoring is assumed by a professor or designee (Racette et al.,
2017). This involves accompanying students in their learning process,
acting as a moderator, facilitator, coach, pedagogical mentor, e-tutor,
coach, etc.
</p>
<p>
When they take up their positions, new professors are quickly called
upon to develop distance supervision practices and, as Vachon (2013)
points out, to develop multiple skills such as written and oral
communication, the use of ICT, etc.
</p>
<p>
Over the past few months, a research team has been conducting an
analysis of distance education student supervision practices. This
research project, financed by the Fonds de recherche – Société et
culture du gouvernement du Québec (FRQSC), allowed the deployment of the
Observatoire du cours d’action. This theoretical framework allowed for
the deployment of the relative life course tool, a methodological tool
derived from the semiotic framework of the course of action (Theureau,
2004, 2009).
</p>
<p>
This project has three objectives: (1) to describe the coaching
practices of new teachers in their ADF courses, (2) to explain how the
coaching practices of new teachers evolve over time, and (3) to analyze
how new teachers develop their skills in coaching practices in ADF
courses.
</p>
<p>
In this paper, we propose to present the mentoring practices of new
professors in distance education courses over the past few years.

<p>
<p>
During the COVID-19 pandemic, online teaching and learning became the
primary model for education, and we are calling this Emergency Remote
Education (ERE) (Bozkurt et al., 2020). Previous studies have
accumulated rich theories and have proven that student engagement (SE)
is positively related to student’s academic achievement. However, only a
few studies specifically focused on SE in ERE, which constitutes a gap
in the research. This research found that there were differences in
student engagement between F2F and ERE; the main reasons causing
differences were course design and organization, learning with peers,
student-faculty interaction, and social interaction. Students preferred
synchronous courses and subjectively perceived less interaction with
instructors and peers. However, a supportive environment that was
included in the student engagement in F2F learning but not considered as
an influenced factor in the Community of Inquiry model showed in this
study as a constructive factor in ERE. Sharma and Alvi (2021) found that
students were more positive toward blended learning after the pandemic.
The findings of this study provide the reason and theoretical foundation
for the modification of online education.

Ukrainian librarians are champions of positive change despite the
ongoing war with Russia. The academic library of the Ukrainian State
University of Science and Technologies has continued to support students
and faculty, even while working remotely from home basements, sharing
computers, and taking care of each others’ children, despite air-raid
alarms and daily electricity and heating outages. However, this is just
a part of their work. They take every opportunity to advance their open
agenda by upskilling through peer-to-peer learning, participating in
international networks, and adapting existing and creating new OER. They
are building bridges between the present and the future: as soon as this
war is over, Ukrainian librarians will facilitate enhanced teaching and
learning opportunities with fresh, professional skills and external
collaborations.
</p>
<p>
All this while relentlessly facing language issues: rejecting
Russia’s “linguicide” attempts and working with colleagues from other
countries. The latter incentivises the international community to
provide support. The former requires a different strategy: Ukrainian
librarians are actively working to preserve their country’s language and
heritage, ensuring that its history and culture are not forgotten,
despite the war. This presentation offers an opportunity to hear their
story and build new collaborative pathways while strengthening existing
ones.

algorithmic awareness and algorithmic literacy in Higher Education to
promote critical thinking skills towards algorithmic biases and their
impact on social infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
This presentation will address the issue of algorithmic literacy from
an information literacy and metaliteracy perspective. The presenter will
discuss the role of information literacy education in promoting
algorithmic awareness in higher education and address the adoption of
teaching practices to promote critical awareness about algorithms in
post-secondary institutions in Canada.

Many conversations around open education focus on a Eurocentric
framework of copyright and intellectual property rights that are
sometimes in tension with Indigenous knowledge systems. While Indigenous
communities and scholars are interested in making access to Indigenous
Knowledges a more integral part of a decolonized and Indigenized
post-secondary landscape, this session will explore areas for concern
around the intersections between Open Educational Resources (OERs) and
Indigenous Knowledges. Using Lar-Son’s (2022) 6Rs of Indigenous OERs
framework for advancing Indigenous Knowledges through Open Education
pedagogies and resources, this session will explore some of the
principles and practices for engaging with Indigenous communities in the
creation of OERs. Additionally, the session will discuss four different
OER case studies featuring Indigenous perspective and Indigenous
Knowledges from across Canada, including from an ‘in the works’ edited
volume, that centre Indigenous ways of knowing, culture, experiences,
and worldviews within the work of open education pedagogy and OER
development.
