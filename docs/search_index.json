Building on this background work, we explore the values and attitudes of the academics who undertake open textbook production with student co- creators. Student inclusion is lauded in research as essential for student belonging, but little work has been done to look for the challenges involved when traditional power dynamics are disrupted. In this research, we describe a potential nexus of three complementary components: open textbooks, social justice, and students as partners. We investigate the affordances of the open textbook to facilitate change in the power dynamics of content production as well as in classroom practice.

Eight years later in a post TRC society, what truths remain untold? What lessons have we learned in trying to mobilize meaningful change? How can we as educators, uphold our responsibilities in the work of rebuilding the broken relationship that has brought us to this space?
