She holds the UNESCO chair in Open Education and Social Justice (2021-2024). She is on the editorial board of the International Journal of Students as Partners (joined in 2022). She is passionate about the role of Open Education in the changing world of Higher Education. Dr Glenda Cox is currently the Principal Investigator in the Digital Open Textbooks for Development (DOT4D) initiative. Her current research includes analysing the role of open textbooks for social justice. Bianca is a Junior Research Fellow in the Digital Open Textbooks for Development (DOT4D) project and drives the research arm of the initiative. She is currently a PhD candidate in Anthropology at UCT. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology and Psychology and a Master’s in Social Anthropology from the University of Witwatersrand. Her work has revolved around gender, sexuality, youth and health, with a great interest in how young people experience, interrogate and contribute to the worlds around them. Her doctoral work explores understandings of TB in the township of Khayelitsha through a youth-based community engagement project. Her research background and varied research experiences fuel her current interests in open education, open educational resources, open textbooks and social justice with a keen interest in the inclusion and recognition of student voices. Enabling ‘Students as Partners’: Open Textbooks, Power Shifts and Curriculum Transformation Work done with open textbook creators at UCT has enabled the DOT4D initiative to articulate models of open textbook production that are being employed by academics at UCT who are using their open textbooks to address social (in)justice in the classroom. Building on this background work, we explore the values and attitudes of the academics who undertake open textbook production with student co- creators. Student inclusion is lauded in research as essential for student belonging, but little work has been done to look for the challenges involved when traditional power dynamics are disrupted. In this research, we describe a potential nexus of three complementary components: open textbooks, social justice, and students as partners. We investigate the affordances of the open textbook to facilitate change in the power dynamics of content production as well as in classroom practice.

She is also the editor-in-chief of the Handbook of Academic Integrity (2nd ed., Springer), which is currently under development. Faculty Profile Personal Blog Twitter LinkedIn Academic Integrity in the Age of Artificial Intelligence How worried do we need to be that students are going to cheat more because of artificial intelligence? Does writing generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) writing app constitute plagiarism? How can artificial intelligence be used ethically for teaching, learning, and assessment? Will a robot take my job? These questions have dominated teaching and learning circles and social media since late 2022 when ChatGPT emerged. In this Keynote, Sarah provides insights into how AI tools are impacting higher education. She will share insights from recent research project at the University of Calgary that explores the question: What are the ethical implications of artificial intelligence technologies for teaching, learning, and assessment? Nick Bertrand University of Calgary Wednesday, May 31, 11:00 AM Session Link Nick is a proud Kanyen’keha:ka and member of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte. He is a father, partner, uncle, and educator. Sharing truth alongside messages of hope and resiliency through the vehicle of education is what interests and drives Nick. Nick has worked in education for over 17 years in many roles including: a high school OCT certified teacher, a school board Indigenous Education Lead, and more recently as an Education Officer in the Ministry of Education. In September 2015, Nick was seconded to the Ministry of Education where he had the opportunity to work collaboratively on the development of Ontario’s curriculum strategy for the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Nick currently works in the Indigenous Education Office within the Ministry of Education and also works independently to support the recruitment, hiring, and retainment of Indigenous Peoples in the private sector workforce. Grounded by the incredible support and generosity of Elders, Knowledge Keepers, community, family, and friends has allowed Nick to share space in a variety of educational settings. To move along a reconciliatory path, Nick has always believed that the foundation of this journey is rooted in strong relationships built on respect, understanding, and reciprocity. Progressing truth, confronting complacency, and unleashing the possibility of healing through education. Education as a tool for both healing and reconciliation has been an evolving movement over the years, and in particular since the release the of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 94 Calls to Action. Eight years later in a post TRC society, what truths remain untold? What lessons have we learned in trying to mobilize meaningful change? How can we as educators, uphold our responsibilities in the work of rebuilding the broken relationship that has brought us to this space? As the reconciliatory bridge continues to be constructed, education systems will continue to play a keystone role in the process of building awareness, understanding, and creating action. Paul Prinsloo Friday, June 2, 11:00 AM Session Link Paul Prinsloo is a Research Professor in Open and Distance Learning (ODL) in the Department of Business Management, College of Economic and Management Sciences, University of South Africa (Unisa). He is a Visiting Professor at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany as well as at the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), a Research Associate for Contact North/Contact Nord (Canada), a Fellow of the European Distance and E-Learning Network (EDEN), member of the Executive Committee for the Society of Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) and serves on several editorial boards. His research focuses on student success in distributed education contexts, the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data in learning analytics, and digital identities. He was born curious and in trouble and nothing has changed since then. He blogs and can be found on Twitter and Mastodon.social. The (un)bearable lightness of student data privacy: reckonings and re-imaginings Education has always collected and used student learning data in combination with a range of other data e.g., demographic, financial and prior learning data for a variety of purposes such as to assess and monitor students’ progress, identify students who may need additional support. There has always been concerns about possible bias, stereotyping and impact of categorization of students. Students’ (data)(learning) privacy were somewhere to be found among files being carried from one office to the other, files that got misplaced, unlocked storages and, possibly, a laissez-faire approach to protecting student data privacy because what happened in the classroom and school, stayed in the classroom (mostly). Even if this portrayal of student data privacy may sound idealistic and rather, simplistic, we must reckon how the increasing digitalization and datafication of teaching and learning changes not only the scope of student (data) privacy, but also attempts to protect their (and our) data. In this presentation I hope to provoke thinking about the (un)bearable lightness of student data privacy and consider what it means for students, faculty, institutional data governance amid the intensification and expansion of the data gaze.

Institutional processes such as procurement tend to be absent from conversations about digital education, often acknowledged as problematic but also outside our sphere of influence or domain of expertise. On the basis that pedagogy and technology are entangled in complex ways, in fact the opposite should be true. The educational technologies we use are not tools, and should be treated as matters of quality when we consider what good digital education might look like, and what we think the purpose of education is. Consideration of ethics are often absent from procurement of technology, largely based on instrumentalist assumptions about the neutrality of technologies. Public sector procurement “best practice” also forces us to use poor proxies for our educational values, purposes, and contexts, and creates new risks and liabilities for institutions, at the same time as it seeks to minimise others. Whilst this talk will explore potential solutions to current procurement process and practice, the question that remains outstanding is whether we are simply buying and/or using too much educational technology, and whether, in order to achieve more environmentally sustainable and just forms of education, we should be embracing a de-growth approach to educational technology more generally? How much procurement of edtech, however well executed, is too much? Bio TBA Nicole Johnson Canadian Digital Learning Research Association/Association canadienne de recherche sur la formation en ligne Session Link Digital Learning Trends in Canadian Post-Secondary Education Join Dr. Nicole Johnson, Executive Director of the Canadian Digital Learning Research Association/Association canadienne de recherche sur la formation en ligne (CDLRA/ACRFL), as she shares how digital learning trends are changing over time and discusses what this means for the future of post-secondary education in Canada.

Alec Couros University of Regina Harnessing the Power of AI in Education: Opportunities and Challenges Session Link In this presentation, Dr. Alec Couros will explore the exciting possibilities and impact of AI in education, focusing on tools such as ChatGPT. With the ability to provide personalized learning experiences, AI has the potential to transform the way we teach and learn. However, its integration into the classroom also raises important ethical and societal concerns. Dr. Couros will examine both the opportunities and challenges of AI in education. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the potential of AI to positively impact student learning and success, as well as the considerations and challenges that must be addressed in order to fully embrace it in our learning environments. Bio TBA Unpacking the Tensions between Indigenous Knowledges and Open Education: Exploring Lar-Son’s 6Rs for Indigenous OERs in Practice Brad Wuetherick University of British Columbia – Okanagan Campus Session Link Many conversations around open education focus on a Eurocentric framework of copyright and intellectual property rights that are sometimes in tension with Indigenous knowledge systems. While Indigenous communities and scholars are interested in making access to Indigenous Knowledges a more integral part of a decolonized and Indigenized post-secondary landscape, this session will explore areas for concern around the intersections between Open Educational Resources (OERs) and Indigenous Knowledges. Using Lar-Son’s (2022) 6Rs of Indigenous OERs framework for advancing Indigenous Knowledges through Open Education pedagogies and resources, this session will explore some of the principles and practices for engaging with Indigenous communities in the creation of OERs. Additionally, the session will discuss four different OER case studies featuring Indigenous perspective and Indigenous Knowledges from across Canada, including from an ‘in the works’ edited volume, that centre Indigenous ways of knowing, culture, experiences, and worldviews within the work of open education pedagogy and OER development.

Monday May 29 Jennifer Wemigwans OISE University of Toronto Session Link Digital Bundles: A Reckoning and a Re-imagining Digital Bundles create cultural space for Indigenous Knowledge through the use of new technologies. The concept for Digital Bundles comes from a tradition that respects diverse Elders and Knowledge Keepers as the custodians of community Knowledge Bundles. Sharing Digital Bundles online represent new spaces for Indigenous Knowledge in the form of Open Education. Digital Bundles are both a Reckoning and amRe-imagining of online space. For non-indigenous audiences, Digital Bundles challenge them to step outside of their codified systems and learn a new way of being and perceiving the world. For Indigenous audiences, Digital Bundles are a new way to share the brilliance of diverse Indigenous Knowledges with new generations. Bio Jennifer Wemigwans, PhD, is from Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory on Manitoulin Island, Ontario. She is a new media producer, writer and scholar specializing in the convergence between education, Indigenous knowledge and new media technologies.

She is an Assistant Professor in the Adult Education and Community Development Program at OISE University of Toronto. Isabel Pedersen Ontario Tech University Session Link Shock and Awe: Generative AI Composition, Cultural Adaptation, and Postsecondary Education The launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT was a dramatic event making generative artificial intelligence a mainstream phenomenon. Data journalist, Katharina Buchholz explains that “ChatGPT gained one million users just five days after launching in November” of 2022 (Statista, 2023). Generative AI can produce stylistically correct sentences, paragraphs, and documents across a multitude of genres. It can produce professional-grade visual images and video. While heavily debated, one could argue that generative AI ‘creates’. Consequently, generative AI can help students create art, write, or collaborate with other students. However, generative AI can complete all of these tasks for students without requiring much human effort, disturbing the general premise of learning to compose. At the same time, its creations are vulnerable to producing false information and discriminatory results due to the training sources. This presentation argues that shock instigated by large tech companies, releasing these products through the rhetoric of hype and fear, is fuelling mass adoption rather than a measured approach. Educators, students, and university administrators are faced with handling the cultural adaptation to AI generators that challenge traditions of human creativity and formal education. Drawing on media studies and rhetoric (Pedersen and Iliadis 2020), digital literacy studies (Duin and Pedersen 2021), and critical AI studies (Bender, Gebru, McMillan-Major, and Shmitchell 2021), this talk points to the process of re-imagining learning expectations in university courses amid the onslaught of generative AI emergence. Bio TBA Tuesday May 30 Bonnie Stewart University of Windsor Session Link Digital Education in an Age of Data: What Do We Do Now? Session Abstract: TBA Bio TBA Leo Havemann and Panel Members Open University / UCL Session Link Researching at the Edge of Openness: Reflections from GO-GN Members GO-GN, the Global OER Graduate Network, brings together a core group of current doctoral researchers working on open education topics, along with the GO-GN team at the Open University, alumni, other researchers and fellow travellers through open space. And though we travel without uniforms or transporters, like members of Starfleet GO-GNers do go boldly, attempting to push the boundaries of knowledge in the field. Recognising the multiple senses in which education can be open, we approach the concept of openness from various angles and use a range of methods. In this panel discussion members of the network will reflect upon the what, why and how of their doctoral journeys, and invite session participants into our conversation.

While gamification was a strategy that was occasionally used in junior-level anatomy and physiology courses pre-pandemic, it became an increasingly important pedagogical strategy during emergency remote teaching for students to become invested in their learning. Escape rooms, which are immersive storytelling games, are one form of gamification. Educational escape rooms, which can be adapted to be in-person or virtual, incorporate learning objectives into individual or team-based games, puzzles and clues, and require students to demonstrate mastery of the material to progress through the storyline. This type of activity not only helps to increase student engagement, but also provides an opportunity to develop soft skills like creativity, teamwork, decision-making, critical thinking and communication that are important in health professionals. 2:30-3:00 | A(nother) Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against (or For?) Course Hero | Practice Brenna Clarke Gray | Thompson Rivers University Abstract Using Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel’s landmark essay “A Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against Turnitin” as its foil, this presentation asks participants to apply the same kinds of critiques applied effectively to Turnitin in that piece to Course Hero as we evaluate its claims against the benchmarks of ethical educational technologies. This experiment in collective meaning-making provides a model for critiquing tools that have been carefully marketed but not well-studied by academics, offering a “way in” to these discussions that is rooted in the practical and factual, and not so profoundly shaped by personalities of influence. Concurrent Session 2.2 | Sustaining Positive Change Session Link 1:30-2:30 | Engaging in Open Pedagogy: Insights from Designing and Teaching Post-Secondary STEM Courses | Practice Elena Chudaeva | George Brown College Abstract What is Open Pedagogy? Open Pedagogy (OP) is a process, a way of thinking and a way of acting. OP is not a collection of pedagogical procedures. It does not have a set of predetermined outcomes. OP is intentionally inclusive, intentionally ethical, and reflective practice. In this workshop we will look at the implications of “open” in a college setting. How to engage in Open Pedagogy in a STEM college course? We will have a look at the Physics for Health course: its design, teaching strategies, and OER that support OP. We will discuss what does it mean in practice to participate in OP and what opportunities it presents to support diverse learners and what challenges such practice presents for an educator. The following questions will guide the workshop: - How can Open Educational Resources extend into Open Pedagogy? - How similar and different Open Pedagogy and Inclusive Pedagogy are? - How can Open Pedagogy impact accessibility and inclusion? - What is the teacher’s role in Open Pedagogy? - What role does technology play in Open Pedagogy? 2:30-3:00 | An Upgrade to Ungrading: Alternative Grading in Higher Education | Practice Sharon Lauricella | Ontario Tech University Rebekah Bennetch | University of Saskatchewan Abstract The various practices of “ungrading” have gained increasing popularity, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Ungrading – or what we prefer to call alt-grading – can increase intrinsic motivation, alleviate anxiety associated with judgment, and can invite students to take intellectual risks without fear of being punished or suffering long-term effects if an academic experiment does not work. The many benefits of alternative grading include some degree of freedom from such stress and fear. However, most university administrations resist revisions to traditional grading, and as such, precarious faculty with their students’ best interests at heart often struggle to implement creative, helpful strategies to release students from the stressful grip of judgment and grades. Further, some ungrading “purists” (particularly on social media) are unwelcoming to educators who must or would like to include some fundamental parts of ungrading but must still “fit” within the constraints of the traditional university grading system. This interactive, helpful, and friendly session will be a candid look at what alternative grading really is, what it could be, and how innovative educators seeking to work within a traditional system can address how to move forward with alternatives that are legitimate “upgrades” to “ungrading.” Concurrent Session 2.3 | Transitions of Online Learning &amp; Teaching Session Link 1:30-2:00 | Creating Capacity for Capabilities: Using Professional Development within Learning Design in Capstone | Practice Sonja Johnston | University of Calgary Abstract During the peak of the pandemic, where emergency remote learning was required, undergraduate students trying to complete a business degree had a choice between business capstone and practicum. Unfortunately for our students, there were nearly no positions available as businesses had decreased their workforce numbers so substantially and were canceling practicum positions. This created a very large influx of students through the capstone pathway. This 6-credit hour course is a culmination of student learning throughout the degree and is the final experience prior to graduation. A growing number of industry and scholarly reports explore the disconnect between graduate capabilities and employer expectations regarding workplace skill competencies (Lapointe &amp; Turner, 2020; Mishra et al., 2019; RBC, 2019). Highlighted through consecutive semesters of capstone through 2020 to 2022, an opportunity arose to scaffold a professional development module into the learning design. The author will present the structure, purpose, implementation, and challenges of the module and provide initial insights of the value and iteration through this time period. The content of the module will be shared as it leans into open and accessible training and development. A discussion of the current state and collaboratively brainstorming options next iteration will be undertaken. 2:00-2:30 | “Leave No One Behind.” Peer Support for Teachers: Reflections on a Digital Pedagogy Development Project | Practice Susanna Kohonen, Helena Kantanen, Kati Kasanen, Vesa Paajanen &amp; Piia Siitonen | University of Eastern Finland Abstract This presentation overviews and discusses an on-going peer support method launched by a Finnish university for their teaching staff. The aim of the peer support method is to further develop the pedagogical and digital skills adopted during the Covid19 pandemic. Moreover, its aim is to re-imagine higher education by promoting best practices of online learning and teaching based on staff experiences and relevant research. The university recruited a team of five experienced lecturers from within its four faculties and the Language Centre to work as pedagogical support to their peers at a 50% work-time allocation, the other 50% of their work still consisting of teaching. The team recently finished its first two-year operation period and has analysed and reported the successes and challenges of the first two years, with recommendations for the following two years. The team’s analysis of the first two-year period indicates that this peer support mode has proven a necessary modus operandi. In an institution of higher education with its multiple departments, units, boards, working groups, committees, support services, and digital services, the voice of a single teacher may too easily go unheard. In its reflexive analysis of the first two years of operation, the team highlights four areas of success. Alongside with the successes, challenges do remain, and must be addressed in the following two years of operation. The main challenges are directly connected to the successes. The core challenge concerns the need to keep improving university-wide, accessible, and efficient communication of all the services and support that are available to the teaching staff. 2:30-3:00 | Mediating Relationship and Sexual Health Education | Practice Andrea Hasenbank | Onlea Studios Abstract This session will outline the development of a youth sexual health education program adapted from a series of facilitated in-person workshops to a self-guided, asynchronous online format. The development focused on three key considerations: (1) accessibility, which includes addressing different learning and physical abilities, as well as technical elements relating to devices and rural internet networks; (2) privacy, which includes protection of student information, questions relating to cross-border data hosting, and the ability of participants to ask questions and receive support anonymously; and (3) mediation, which includes how the design of the course must compensate for the loss of an in-person facilitator. The course modules have focused on the use of narrative as a strategy for introducing concepts, connecting to real-world scenarios, and promoting empathy and engagement in the absence of a facilitator. The session will discuss how choices of tools and technologies have addressed the program’s stated considerations, as well as allowed for innovative use of character and storytelling to promote sexual health education. Concurrent Session 2.4 | Sustaining Positive Change Session Link 1:30-2:00 | Sharing Experience Regarding OER Creation and Adoption as a Tool to Manage Student Engagement | Research Kiranjot Kaur &amp; Kimberlee Carter | Conestoga College ITAL Abstract This presentation supports the view that Open Educational Resources (OER) have positive impact on pedagogy and student engagement. OER supporters believe that OERs offer compelling implications on pedagogy including increasing level of student engagement and pedagogical innovation (Open Education Quality Initiatives, 2011 and Orr et al., 2015). A community college faculty member and administrator who supported the faculty member with the Open Educational Resources (OER) project will share how creation and adaptation of OER in the course lead to positive impact on student engagement. OER enabled pedagogy assures student engagement as well increases self-regulated motivation (Werth &amp; Williams, 2021). A notation that the supporting administrator has noticed is that when the same faculty member designs the OER and then facilitates the course, the OER is adopted then anecdotally has greater results then when OER is adopted without creative input or customization. The administrator wonders that if faculty do not have the time to evaluate content to the same degree as an OER creator does they may lose the value of deep connection with content as noted by Skidmore (2019). 2:00-2:30 | Developing a Learning Design Framework: A Collective Process Intended to Foster Collaboration | Practice Melissa Jakubec &amp; Michelle Harrison | Thompson Rivers University Abstract This proposal describes the development of a learning design framework by an instructional design team in an open learning division of a medium-sized university. The team recognized the need for a foundation that reflected their values and guiding principles for design and aimed to build tools that would strengthen collaborative relationships and create a more inclusive and learner-centered experience. The framework is intended to be used as a tool for framing conversations with collaborative teams to ensure the principles of caring, connection, openness and active learning are considered in our learning design. In the presentation, we will provide examples of the framework and its underlying principles and focus on how it can support collaborations among various teams and stakeholders. The team is still in the process of building collaborative and practical elements to support course development and will share both these projects and how the framework is helping to reframe processes and clarify roles. 2:30-3:00 | Reimagining Art and Culture by Decolonizing Digitization | Practice Amanda Figueroa | Curationist Abstract Museums, archives, galleries, and libraries have balanced their responsibility to protect the world’s most important cultural artifacts with their roles as important pillars of public education. However, these goals become increasingly at odds with each other if the institution doesn’t take a deliberately decolonial, and anticolonial, stance towards curatorial work. Left unexamined, contemporary curatorial practice still carries the legacies of colonization, which is visible in the metadata of digitized collections from major institutions like the British Museum. This presentation outlines the necessary role of decolonial practice in GLAM-field digitization projects as well as in the digital tools that make this content available to public audiences. By centering on the co-developed metadata tools of Curationist, we will offer not only an introduction to this platform and its uses to digital art and open education, but also a method of online community development that centers indigenous data sovereignty, community engagement, and decolonization practices to rebalance the power dynamic in collections-based open education. Concurrent Session 2.5 | Sustaining Positive Change Session Link 1:30-2:00 | Qu’en est-il de l’enseignement et de l’apprentissage de la danse à distance ? Adaptations et défis (in French) | Research Cathia Papi | Université TÉLUQ Abstract The health measures imposed in 2020-2021 have led to the development of distance learning courses in the field of leisure. Be it music, yoga, cooking, etc., many courses have been offered online. This has been particularly the case with dance. As distance learning dance classes were rare before the pandemic, new practices had to be developed. How have dancers adapted to this change in training mode and what challenges have they faced in teaching or learning online? In this paper, we propose to look at the challenges faced by teachers and learners of recreational dance. To do so, we will rely not only on the literature published on the subject, but also and especially, on interviews conducted with 78 professional and amateur dancers living in Quebec and France. We will highlight the technologies and teaching methods used in these courses as well as their advantages and limitations according to the teachers and learners. We will then open a discussion on the perspectives of online dance courses. 2:00-2:30 | Que dit la recherche des approches pour contrer l’isolement en FAD ? (in French) | Research Cathia Papi, Serge Gérin-Lajoie &amp; Wanderlucy Czeszak | Université TÉLUQ Aristide Tsayem Tchoupou | Université Laval Abstract While student isolation was a major issue during the pandemic, a systematic review of the literature conducted as part of the SSHRC’s Knowledge Synthesis program allowed us to review the scientific literature on support aimed at limiting the sense of isolation of students in distance education (DE). This study was conducted on scientific papers published between 2012 and 2022 and led to the examination of 301 articles in French or in English. The analysis of these publications highlights three main approaches to supporting distance education students: the approach focused on developing student autonomy and commitment; the approach focused on the support of a teacher or mentor; and the approach focused on peer-to-peer interactions and collaborative work. In this paper, we propose to review each of these three approaches and to outline the strengths and weaknesses that researchers have identified. We can then discuss how they can be addressed to provide DE. Finally, we will conclude with some possible directions for future research. 2:30-3:00 | A Framework for Evaluating the Creation and Adaptation of Open Textbooks | Melissa Ashman | Kwantlen Polytechnic University Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in dramatic growth in the use of open education resources, such as open textbooks, as classes moved online around the world. This highlighted the importance of evaluating the creation and adaptation of open textbooks used in online courses. In reviewing the research literature, I found existing rubrics or frameworks were outdated and lacked criteria that are important in today’s digital age. Therefore, I synthesized the evaluation and quality criteria from 31 articles into a single framework, which online instructors can consider using as they create or adapt an open textbook. The criteria include content, accessibility, technology, open licenses, instructional design, and a new category I termed verification. Break | 3:00-3:45 Concurrent Session 3 | 3:45-5:15 1.5 Hours Concurrent Session 3.1 | Addressing Inequities Session Link 3:45-4:45 | The Seemingly Small Details that are Easily Overlooked in Designing Inclusive Online Courses | Practice Tai Munro, Ashley Stasiewich &amp; Susan Cauti | MacEwan University Abstract While distance and online education are not new, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges that students can face with online learning. These challenges can magnify inequity and increase resistance to learning. Many educators have used the pandemic as motivation to reassess their courses but still often overlook seemingly small aspects that can make a big difference for students. Examples of these aspects might include mobile compatibility, video length, and technological requirements. The three panelists are experienced instructional designers and instructors who have focused on improving accessibility in online learning in a variety of contexts. They will share their experiences as both advocates and skeptics on why we need to take the small things into account to develop courses which facilitate learning for all students without exhausting instructors who are experiencing their own barriers and challenges. 4:45-5:15 | Podcasting for Student Agency | Research Yu-Ling Lee &amp; Nina Lui | Trinity Western University Keywords: Abstract This article explores the potential of podcasting as a useful education technology for promoting agency in preservice teacher education programs. The authors propose a mixed-methods study to investigate the impact of co-creating podcasts as a holistic pedagogical practice. Reporting on the first phase of this research, podcasting appears to helpfully assess student learning. Additionally, it is a powerful technology that can mobilize knowledge created by preservice teachers beyond the classroom. Next stages in the research will incorporate in-service teachers to provide generative feedback, thereby creating a Community of Inquiry between podcasters and listeners. Concurrent Session 3.2 | Sustaining Positive Change Session Link 3:45-4:45 | The Slow Trend Toward K-12 OER Sharing | Practice Connie Blomgren | Athabasca University Beth Cormier | University of Lethbridge Kathy Wise | University of Calgary Abstract For K-12 teachers sharing resources is a long established professional practice and with the affordances of digital technologies the ability to file share has been amplified. However, there are technological and copyright implications of sharing curricular teaching content that requires more support and understanding. Copyright ease and ethical sharing of curriculum resources is provided by open licenses yet pre-service and graduate education students currently receive inconsistent tutelage of these licenses. To fill this niche for understanding, locating, or creating OER, the website Openteacherab.ca has been developed. Further support for these students to determine OER quality is the ISKME curation framework that assists with the selection and assessment of pre-existing K-12 OER. Looking to Washington State provides a further example of support for the slow trend toward K-12 OER sharing and development. 4:45-5:15 | Letting Go of Holding On: Promoting Student Choice in a Post- Pandemic Classroom | Practice Rebekah Bennetch | University of Saskatchewan Abstract The pandemic has forced teachers to adapt with greater flexibility to meet changing classroom environments and student needs, resulting in a shift in pedagogy towards promoting more intrinsic motivation and student autonomy. OTESSA’s theme of “Reckonings and Re-imaginings” reflects this transition, inviting educators to re-evaluate their approach. One effective way to achieve this kind of shift is to give students more freedom and choice in their learning, as supported by the work of Evans and Boucher (2015). This presentation will outline practical strategies for promoting more student choice in the classroom, such as incorporating formative assessment exercises, opening student work to include OER projects, and tips on changing one’s teaching mindset. Participants will be encouraged to reflect on opportunities for making small but meaningful changes to their pedagogy to inspire more student autonomy. Concurrent Session 3.3 | Wildcard Session Link 3:45 - 4:45 | Whiteboard Animation for Dental Education | Research Nazlee Sharmin, Ava K Chow &amp; Mike Carbonaro | University of Alberta Abstract Teaching complex scientific concepts in an engaging manner is challenging for educators. Animated videos can explain concepts and engage students by combining audio messages with changing graphics. Whiteboard animation is a style of animated video where the content appears to be hand-drawn on a whiteboard and narrated in a storytelling manner. This technique has the benefits of traditional animations, with the added ability to combine visual thinking and storytelling. Whiteboard animations were successfully applied to explain health-related topics. Creating a successful whiteboard animation requires paid software, time, and drawing skills. Most whiteboard animation software is designed for business advertising and does not provide the graphics gallery needed to explain health science-related topics. We used traditional PowerPoint and hand-drawn digital images to create whiteboard animation explaining topics for dental education. The built-in animations of PowerPoint were used to animate the images and supporting text. We aim to create a series of whiteboard animations for dental students. According to Dewey, learning is a social activity resulting from human interactions. Studies found that avatars, cartoon characters, dialogues, and simulated real-world settings in animated videos serve an essential social function in engaging students. We hope the whiteboard animations will be beneficial for dental students. 4:45 - 5:15 | In-class gaming to improve students’ learning experiences in dental education | Research Nazlee Sharmin &amp; Ava K Chow | University of Alberta Abstract Higher educational institutes increasingly focus on incorporating games and simulations to enhance student engagement. Gamification refers to using or adopting game mechanics, techniques, and game theory in a non-game platform, like education. Many health professional education courses have successfully applied gamification. Online games like Kahoot are shown to increase student satisfaction and motivation, help students overcome individual difficulties, and improve collaboration. Gimkit is a new gaming platform that allows instructors to create quiz games that students can play live in class. The instantly generated code by the host allows students to enter live games without having an account or registration. We have introduced in-class gaming using Gimkit in the Dentistry and Dental Hygiene program at the University of Alberta. The effect of playing games on student learning, motivation, engagement, and satisfaction will be evaluated. We believe in-class gaming will be a positive incorporation in didactic dental education to enhance student motivation and engagement. Concurrent Session 3.4 | Transitions of Online Learning &amp; Teaching Session Link 3:45 - 4:45 | Encadrer des étudiant.es à distance : Description des pratiques de nouveaux professeure.s (in French) | Research Serge Gérin-Lajoie | Université TÉLUQ Abstract Canadian higher education institutions are placing increasing emphasis on the development of distance education (DE) and online learning (Bates et al., 2017). Historically, in ADF institutions, the “traditional” teaching process is split into two phases. In the first stage, courses are designed by a professor or design team. Thereafter, student mentoring is assumed by a professor or designee (Racette et al., 2017). This involves accompanying students in their learning process, acting as a moderator, facilitator, coach, pedagogical mentor, e-tutor, coach, etc. When they take up their positions, new professors are quickly called upon to develop distance supervision practices and, as Vachon (2013) points out, to develop multiple skills such as written and oral communication, the use of ICT, etc. Over the past few months, a research team has been conducting an analysis of distance education student supervision practices. This research project, financed by the Fonds de recherche – Société et culture du gouvernement du Québec (FRQSC), allowed the deployment of the Observatoire du cours d’action. This theoretical framework allowed for the deployment of the relative life course tool, a methodological tool derived from the semiotic framework of the course of action (Theureau, 2004, 2009). This project has three objectives: (1) to describe the coaching practices of new teachers in their ADF courses, (2) to explain how the coaching practices of new teachers evolve over time, and (3) to analyze how new teachers develop their skills in coaching practices in ADF courses. In this paper, we propose to present the mentoring practices of new professors in distance education courses over the past few years. 4:45 - 5:15 | Face to Face, Online or Something in Between – Student Perceptions of Student Engagement in Different Learning Environments | Research Hongran Cui, Michelle Harrison &amp; Victoria Handford | Thompson Rivers University Abstract During the COVID-19 pandemic, online teaching and learning became the primary model for education, and we are calling this Emergency Remote Education (ERE) (Bozkurt et al., 2020). Previous studies have accumulated rich theories and have proven that student engagement (SE) is positively related to student’s academic achievement. However, only a few studies specifically focused on SE in ERE, which constitutes a gap in the research. This research found that there were differences in student engagement between F2F and ERE; the main reasons causing differences were course design and organization, learning with peers, student-faculty interaction, and social interaction. Students preferred synchronous courses and subjectively perceived less interaction with instructors and peers. However, a supportive environment that was included in the student engagement in F2F learning but not considered as an influenced factor in the Community of Inquiry model showed in this study as a constructive factor in ERE. Sharma and Alvi (2021) found that students were more positive toward blended learning after the pandemic. The findings of this study provide the reason and theoretical foundation for the modification of online education. Concurrent Session 3.5 | Sustaining Positive Change Session Link 3:45 - 4:45 | Be(com)ing OE Librarians in Ukraine During Wartime: Taking Down Language Barriers and Practising Inclusion | Practice Paola Corti | SPARC Europe Tetiana Kolesnykova | Ukrainian State University of Science and Technologies Mira Buist- Zhuk | University of Groningen Abstract Ukrainian librarians are champions of positive change despite the ongoing war with Russia. The academic library of the Ukrainian State University of Science and Technologies has continued to support students and faculty, even while working remotely from home basements, sharing computers, and taking care of each others’ children, despite air-raid alarms and daily electricity and heating outages. However, this is just a part of their work. They take every opportunity to advance their open agenda by upskilling through peer-to-peer learning, participating in international networks, and adapting existing and creating new OER. They are building bridges between the present and the future: as soon as this war is over, Ukrainian librarians will facilitate enhanced teaching and learning opportunities with fresh, professional skills and external collaborations. All this while relentlessly facing language issues: rejecting Russia’s “linguicide” attempts and working with colleagues from other countries. The latter incentivises the international community to provide support. The former requires a different strategy: Ukrainian librarians are actively working to preserve their country’s language and heritage, ensuring that its history and culture are not forgotten, despite the war. This presentation offers an opportunity to hear their story and build new collaborative pathways while strengthening existing ones. 4:45 - 5:15 | The Role of Academic Libraries in Fostering of Algorithmic Literacy in Canadian Universities: A Metaliterate | Research Marta Samokishyn | Saint Paul University Abstract Algorithms are becoming an integral part of our socio-digital eco-system: Facebook’s impact on voting practices, Amazon’s resume screening, racial-profiling software, and even one’s ability to get a loan. As a result, there is an urgent need to address the issue of algorithmic awareness and algorithmic literacy in Higher Education to promote critical thinking skills towards algorithmic biases and their impact on social infrastructure. This presentation will address the issue of algorithmic literacy from an information literacy and metaliteracy perspective. The presenter will discuss the role of information literacy education in promoting algorithmic awareness in higher education and address the adoption of teaching practices to promote critical awareness about algorithms in post-secondary institutions in Canada.

With the ability to provide personalized learning experiences, AI has the potential to transform the way we teach and learn. However, its integration into the classroom also raises important ethical and societal concerns. Dr. Couros will examine both the opportunities and challenges of AI in education. Participants will leave with a better understanding of the potential of AI to positively impact student learning and success, as well as the considerations and challenges that must be addressed in order to fully embrace it in our learning environments. 1.0.1 Parallel Session 4.2 Session Link Brad Wuetherick, University of British Columbia – Okanagan Campus Unpacking the Tensions between Indigenous Knowledges and Open Education: Exploring Lar-Son’s 6Rs for Indigenous OERs in Practice Abstract Many conversations around open education focus on a Eurocentric framework of copyright and intellectual property rights that are sometimes in tension with Indigenous knowledge systems. While Indigenous communities and scholars are interested in making access to Indigenous Knowledges a more integral part of a decolonized and Indigenized post-secondary landscape, this session will explore areas for concern around the intersections between Open Educational Resources (OERs) and Indigenous Knowledges. Using Lar-Son’s (2022) 6Rs of Indigenous OERs framework for advancing Indigenous Knowledges through Open Education pedagogies and resources, this session will explore some of the principles and practices for engaging with Indigenous communities in the creation of OERs. Additionally, the session will discuss four different OER case studies featuring Indigenous perspective and Indigenous Knowledges from across Canada, including from an ‘in the works’ edited volume, that centre Indigenous ways of knowing, culture, experiences, and worldviews within the work of open education pedagogy and OER development.

A foundational component to digital transformation in Ontario’s postsecondary sector will be ensuring leaders understand how their influence impacts institutional culture and how that culture either promotes or inhibits innovation. At their core, a Dx leader is responsible for inspiring action within their organization, department, team, classroom, and learners in new and innovative ways. Researchers conducted an environmental scan and qualitative survey for postsecondary leaders and educators to identity gaps in supports of leadership development for Dx. The survey revealed that agility, critical thinking, foresight, data security, analysis, governance, and technology selection and evaluation are key competencies where limited sector level support is available for leaders facing an increasingly digital future. The research team refined these competencies into a five-module professional development program intended to be delivered in online self-paced and interactive facilitated formats. This presentation will discuss the research efforts, competency framework and curriculum development to date. Anyone, at any level of an organization, has the capacity to be a leader, and effective leaders will recognize that capacity in others. The audience will engage in a key activity to take the first step toward becoming a transformative leader for Dx within their institution.

It begins by reviewing national OER advocacy work including the 2018 pre-budget consultation, and the development of regular meetings around national OER advocacy. One outcome of the meetings was the creation of a working group to develop a National Advocacy Framework for Open Educational Resources in Canada (CARL, 2023). The session reviews the Framework’s arguments for federal involvement in OER. It subsequently discusses a series of targeted national working summits of specific issues focused on OER involvement. This includes discussing the November 2022 summit on policy and infrastructure, the planned May 2023 summit on Francophone OER, and the third summit on Indigenous OER. Engagement strategies and the next steps in advocacy work, including the development of prioritized and targeted advocacy statements are discussed. This portion leads the discussion section (15-20 minutes) where attendees will be able to ask questions and discuss how future advocacy work should be shaped. The focus on discussion is underpinned by a commitment to developing a sustained initiative of a diverse array of OER stakeholders on national advocacy.

What is less clear, and less straightforward to investigate, is the extent to which individual higher education institutions are developing policy to support aspects of openness. This session reports on doctoral research work-in-progress investigating the institutional open education policy space. A survey instrument was developed and distributed in order to seek the views of HE staff members internationally. In order to frame the research questions and instruments, inclusive understandings of the concepts ‘open education’ and ‘institutional policy’ have ben adopted. Open education can be described as a wide umbrella term, which can potentially refer to many practices across formal, informal and non-formal education (Author, 2016; Weller et al., 2019). ‘Institutional policy’ is considered to include documented policies, strategies, regulations or guidelines, but also for example, provision of infrastructure, usual courses of action, regular aspects of a person’s work, or funded or supported areas of activity (Author, 2020). Participants in the survey were therefore asked for information and opinions about the intentions and effects of local institutional policies on areas of practice including: - use, creation, sharing and adaptation of open educational resources (OER). - offering of free and lower-cost online courses. - opening up of aspects of learning, teaching and assessment to external participants, partners and audiences. - participating in open professional development communities of practice. The presentation will give an overview of the findings from the survey and consider implications for OE advocates seeking to enhance support for OEP within institutions through policy. 10:00-10:30 | myWATERSHED: A Serious Game for Fostering Sustainability Champions of the Future | Research Isabelle Barrette-Ng | University of Windsor Adam Clare | Sheridan College Abstract Restoration ecology courses stress that students learn the knowledge and leadership skills necessary to successfully restore degraded regions. Yet, traditional classrooms offer limited opportunities to plan and implement restoration due to barriers of ecological, spatial, and temporal scale. To train and empower youth to take on the challenge of ecological restoration, we created the myWATERSHED sandbox game. myWATERSHED utilizes a digital twin of the Humber river watershed to engage learners in restoration using an endangered species, the redside dace. The game creates a realistic simulation where the interactions explore ecological principles and critical challenges, including the concept of spatial, temporal and ecological scale in restoration. myWATERSHED allows students the freedom to explore and manipulate a realistic environment where they can assess restoration strategies, implement efforts under resource constraints, and solicit feedback. Through an autoethnographic process, we will share our experience in building and coordinating the efforts of a multidisciplinary team to create a serious game. We invite participants to share ideas to improve the design of the software and the approach used to manage an interdisciplinary team for educational software development. We hope to hear how participants could adapt or incorporate the game or our approach in their own contexts.

Our research is based on 22 interviews conducted with high school students enrolled in a distance education history course. Results show that some of them greatly missed social interactions and that their motivation and grades suffered from taking courses in that format. On the other hand, some students thrived in that setting and welcomed the increased autonomy and flexibility it provided. In a context where distance education is considered a viable option in an increasing number of cases for high school students, our results indicate that it is not suitable for all students and that some aspects of student support are central to fostering students’ engagement and achievement. 10:00-10:30 | Over the Threshold: Graduate Student Needs in Academic Publishing | Research Christie Hurrell, Susan Beatty | University of Calgary Dana Cramer | Toronto Metropolitan University Jennifer Lee, James Murphy &amp; Caitlin McClurg | University of Calgary Abstract Graduate students are under increasing pressure to participate in academic publishing during their studies, yet comprehensive mentorship and education on this topic may not be available to all students. This study conducted focus groups with graduate students and faculty advisors, to better understand what is challenging to learn and teach on the topic of academic publishing. The purpose of this research was to improve educational supports for graduate students learning how to publish their scholarly research. Academic publishing is referred to as a ‘threshold concept’ in the literature, as students develop a transformational understanding of the academic profession once they gain this knowledge (Townsend et al., 2011). The research team developed a blended learning approach to teaching and learning gaps identified by focus group participants. Our approach uses the lens of “compassionate pedagogy” and comprises both an on-demand, multimedia Open Educational Resource and in person approaches to build community and address the mental wellness aspects of the complex topic of early career academic publishing.

Does writing generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) writing app constitute plagiarism? How can artificial intelligence be used ethically for teaching, learning, and assessment? Will a robot take my job? These questions have dominated teaching and learning circles and social media since late 2022 when ChatGPT emerged. In this Keynote, Sarah provides insights into how AI tools are impacting higher education.

The concept for Digital Bundles comes from a tradition that respects diverse Elders and Knowledge Keepers as the custodians of community Knowledge Bundles. Sharing Digital Bundles online represent new spaces for Indigenous Knowledge in the form of Open Education. Digital Bundles are both a Reckoning and amRe-imagining of online space. For non-indigenous audiences, Digital Bundles challenge them to step outside of their codified systems and learn a new way of being and perceiving the world. For Indigenous audiences, Digital Bundles are a new way to share the brilliance of diverse Indigenous Knowledges with new generations. Parallel Session 6.2 Life Sciences Building LSB 105 Session Link Isabel Pedersen | Ontario Tech University Shock and Awe: Generative AI Composition, Cultural Adaptation, and Postsecondary Education Abstract The launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT was a dramatic event making generative artificial intelligence a mainstream phenomenon. Data journalist, Katharina Buchholz explains that “ChatGPT gained one million users just five days after launching in November” of 2022 (Statista, 2023). Generative AI can produce stylistically correct sentences, paragraphs, and documents across a multitude of genres. It can produce professional-grade visual images and video. While heavily debated, one could argue that generative AI ‘creates’. Consequently, generative AI can help students create art, write, or collaborate with other students. However, generative AI can complete all of these tasks for students without requiring much human effort, disturbing the general premise of learning to compose. At the same time, its creations are vulnerable to producing false information and discriminatory results due to the training sources. This presentation argues that shock instigated by large tech companies, releasing these products through the rhetoric of hype and fear, is fuelling mass adoption rather than a measured approach. Educators, students, and university administrators are faced with handling the cultural adaptation to AI generators that challenge traditions of human creativity and formal education. Drawing on media studies and rhetoric (Pedersen and Iliadis 2020), digital literacy studies (Duin and Pedersen 2021), and critical AI studies (Bender, Gebru, McMillan-Major, and Shmitchell 2021), this talk points to the process of re-imagining learning expectations in university courses amid the onslaught of generative AI emergence.

However, due to a lack of knowledge or skills with regards to educational technologies, K-12 teachers struggle to harness the full potential of digitalisation to support student learning and engagement, causing a risk of marginalisation (Chevalère et al., 2021). The gap in using ICTs is known as the digital divide. Research literature has revealed three levels of digital divide: access, usage and outcomes. In response to these research gaps, the aim of this communication is to explore which high school teaching practices cater for learners’ needs and preferences for the sake of an inclusive use of digital technology that enhances their learning and engagement. As part of a research project funded by the SSHRC, we have conducted individual semi-structured interviews with high school teachers and students aiming to obtain in-depth qualitative data mainly through open-ended questions. A thematic analysis has been employed to inductively analyse the interview data and generate possible themes and categories based on the objectives of our study. Preliminary findings will be available in spring 2023, and will be shared at the OTESSA conference.

Registration, grading, financial operations, alumni communications, and often teaching take place through digital platforms that extract and collate data, about students as well as faculty and staff. At the level of these data system processes, academics may not have the knowledge or practices to fully grasp the shift in their workplace that datafication represents. However, our research suggests that educators do understand the paradigm shift that datafication represents, and have strong beliefs about how institutions should proceed to protect students and academia itself. Our team conducted an in-depth Comparative Case Study (CCS) investigation of how university educators make sense of the datafied infrastructures in and on which they work. This presentation overviews the knowledge, practices, experiences, and perspectives of educators in various institutional status positions from six different countries, in relation to datafied digital tools. We will focus particularly on the barriers that participants articulated to their own engagement with data, at personal, institutional, and societal levels. We will frame ways barriers are reinforced by institutional approaches to datafication, overview participants’ concerns, and explore how datafication has altered faculty’s power position as knowers within the academy.

Since 2018, Wikidata has also stored a new type of data: words, phrases, and sentences, in many languages, described in many languages. This information is stored in new types of entities called lexemes (L), forms (F), and senses (S). This workshop session will walk participants through editing the lexicographic data namespace in Dagbani, English, and one additional language with the help of participants. They will also learn more about how Abstract Wikipedia is developed.

We realized the use of OER reduced educational costs for students and could potentially facilitate students’ learning by allowing for the incorporation of multi-modal (e.g., videos, audios) learning tools as well as other interactive features (e.g., application activities to test learning with immediate feedback). Our guiding research question at the time was: What does an OER for research methods require to address the needs of diverse learners? We had collected survey results, conducted focus groups and were moving towards additional data collection and the development and testing of an OER in research methodologies for students in the Masters of Education program. This promising research was paused in March of 2020 as COVID-19 disrupted our lives and forced us to turn our efforts towards learning how to teach through online alternative modes of instruction. This new reality, opened space for an evolution in our values as educators and our understanding of open pedagogy and OER praxis. After an almost two-year hiatus, inspired by the work of Meger et al (2021), we resumed our collaboration by engaging in structured reflection to examine how we have evolved as educators and researchers engaged with OER development and where we anticipate taking the research from this new place of maturity. Today, we are better positioned to answer that question after being influenced by factors that shifted our perspectives and values. We will share our initial insights into student perspectives of OERs and follow with a critical examination of existing OERs relevant for research methods in education to identify the extent to which they reflect the values we now adhere to. Our interactive presentation will inspire educators, instructional designers and OER researchers to reflect upon their values and understanding of open education practices. It is through this structured reflection that collectively we can capitalize on opportunities for transformation even through the complexities of a crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic. 4:30-5:00 | Showcasing a Student-Led Anti-Racism Virtual Simulation Module for Equitable Learning | Practice Life Sciences Building LSB 101 Mujeedat Lekuti, HanShu Pu, Rishika Gowda, Zainab Baig, Javeria Baig, Alexandra Lawrynuik | Queen’s University Canada Laura Killam | Cambrian College Marian Luctkar-Flude | Queen’s University Canada Abstract White-centric perspectives manifest in many North American higher education cultures and systems, which results in inequities disproportionately impacting learners of colour’s well-being. Such racial aggressions produce ‘racial battle fatigue,’ referring to the impact of physiological, physiological, and behavioural stress. Virtual simulation is proposed as an educational strategy to raise awareness of racism in an academic setting and promote allyship for equity-seeking groups. A virtual simulation module was developed to bring awareness to racism. It consists of introductory videos, two simulations, resources, and debriefing prompts and is developed based on lived and observed experiences of a diverse group of learners and educators. The scenes highlight the need to retire the term ’micro’agression and allow participants to take on the role of a bystander and follow the ARISE model, encompassing five key elements: (1) awareness, (2) responding with empathy, (3) inquiring about facts, (4) using “I” statements, and (5) educating and engaging. With this, we seek to bring awareness of racial inequities in the curriculum by: (1) illustrating how racism affects people in their learning environment, (2) demonstrating how bystanders might apply the ARISE model to help a person experiencing racism in an educational setting, and (3) learning how to be an ally. Addressing covert and overt racism instances may translate to more equitable learning.

In 2021, the researchers conducted an environmental scan to discover if and how adaptive learning technologies are being leveraged in Ontario’s higher education sector. While the scan did not identify any large-scale adaptive learning projects, it did find that educators in Ontario see great value in these innovative technologies but that they perceive them as expensive and complex. Based on these findings, in 2022 the researchers conducted a series of webinars for the postsecondary sector with the objective of building a greater awareness of adaptive learning and countering the prevailing narrative of complexity. These webinars featured six Ontario institution and edtech vendor collaborations using different types of adaptive technologies that personalize learning pathways. This practice-based presentation will feature a compilation of best practices derived from these collaborations and provide attendees an opportunity to explore some of the featured technologies. 4:30-5:00 | Conducting Scoping Reviews: Opportunities and Challenges for Examining Social Media Use for Learning | Research Richard Hayman &amp; Erika E. Smith | Mount Royal University Life Sciences Building LSB 101 Abstract There is growing recognition among scholarly communities of the value that literature reviews contribute to synthesizing knowledge and understanding important research issues. While different review methodologies (e.g., scoping, systematic, meta-analysis, etc.) use distinct standards and methods, they typically share a common purpose: to position and connect a particular research problem within a greater context, to identify related research, and to provide a direction and rationale for further study in the area (McGregor, 2018). In looking back on, and ahead to, key issues, trends, and gaps in the field of educational technology, conducting reviews and examining the methodological approaches used in reviews are necessary activities. Speaking to the theme of “Reckonings and (Re)Imagining,” in this session, we will critically discuss why and how such reviews can and should contribute value, now and into the future. Using the case of our current review project on undergraduate use of social media technologies, and with the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) as our primary lens, we will present an example process for establishing a scoping review protocol. By taking stock of the wider opportunities, challenges, and lessons learned for scoping reviews as meta-research contributions to the field, we invite critical discussion amongst SoTL and educational technology scholars considering ways to potentially enhance or extend their own literature review processes.

By implementing a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) model, a small team from the Centre for Educational Excellence at Simon Fraser University aimed to support instructors through collaboration on the design and development of blended courses. Facing two significant challenges of pandemic burnout and widely varying proficiency with the use of learning technology, the FLC model aimed to keep well-being at the forefront with a focus on intentionality and community. Early observations reveal mixed results in terms of course design outcomes and instructor perception of their blended learning journey. Through the process, important questions about institutional approaches to blended learning have come into view, and will serve as the basis for discussion both in the session and moving forward.

DeBarger (2019), suggests that open educational resources (OER), specifically, may be an effective alternative to traditional resources to enhance both student and teacher agency. Marcus-Quinn and Hourigan (2017), acknowledge OER in the development and improvement of teaching effectiveness through more open sharing and development of pedagogy. Similarly, Allen and Katz (2019) posit that teachers are well-positioned to evolve open educational practices and saw that increasing their opportunities to engage openly in a safe environment may impact their self-efficacy and willingness to share openly in the future (Allen &amp; Katz, 2022). Yet, scholars have argued that the research and practice of open education in K-12 is underdeveloped, lacks policy direction, and thus awareness remains low (Blomgren, 2018; Blomgren &amp; MacPherson, 2018). Teacher education programs have a key role to play in developing open education literacies during teacher training. Taking an expansive view of open education, this may include developing competencies around pedagogical approaches, resource selection, assessment design, and technology use that is driven by openness. There appear to be similar themes in teacher education programs such as accessibility, community engagement, inquiry-driven learning, multimodality, growth mindset, collaboration, mindfulness, and multiculturalism that align well to open educational practices. This presentation will focus on the ways in which teacher educators might bring aspect of open education into teacher education programs. I will share the results of a literature review on open education in K-12 contexts, a preliminary survey that identifies awareness gaps related to open education, and invite reflections on how teacher educators might introduce open education to emerging teachers in a meaningful way. 10:00-10:30 | Technological Distance: A New Way of Conceptualizing the “Distance” in Distance Learning | Research Jon Dron | Athabasca University Abstract This paper presents the concept of technological distance, which describes a gap between technologies (broadly defined to include methods, tools, principles, and processes) available for a learner to learn, and those needed to complete that learning. This gap is a measure of both the participation and autonomy of learners in the process. Available technologies may include those provided by teachers and institutions as well as from many others, most notably including the learners themselves. The technologies that make up the assembly are only components, however. What matters most is how learners fill the gaps between them to achieve their learning goals. These are fundamentally situated, idiosyncratic, and human. Technological distance provides new insights into other models that use spatial metaphors, such as the presences of communities of inquiry and transactional distance.

Overlaps and Differences in Online Learning | Research Behnoosh Khoramrooz, Mariel Miller &amp; Valerie Irvine | University of Victoria Abstract Feeling connected and supported in online learning-related studies has been mentioned as an essential factor in motivation, engagement and persistence. Following key elements like having an individualized conversation, providing support, promoting cooperation, demonstrating awareness, showing care, acceptance, and help and providing the opportunity to have friendly communication lead us to different constructs in the area, like relatedness, sense of belonging, connectedness, and social presence. The question is, what are the differences between these constructs? And how each of them contributes to the online learning context. This session dedicates to comparing these constructs by referring to their definitions, roots, theories, and contributions to online learning research. 10:00-10:30 | Hybrid Learning in Ontario During COVID-19 Emergency Closures | Research Beyhan Farhadi | York University Abstract This presentation approaches online learning during COVID-19 emergency closures through the lens of critical policy analysis, through which policy is understood as not just responding to but also productive of problems. Drawing from the second phase of a two-year study on the enactment of COVID-19 education policy by secondary teachers, we analyse the context for and expansion of hybrid learning in Ontario. Hybrid learning broadly refers to the simultaneous teaching of students online by a teacher with students in-person. During March and April 2022 we spoke with nine teachers in three school districts to understand variables impacting their enactment of hybrid learning in a rapidly changing context of crisis that our study found impacted student and teacher well being, workload, and educational equity. Findings juxtapose the stated aims of public education and the demands of crisis alongside the realities confronting students and teachers. This reflects equity concerns, including access to the internet and technology, digital literacy, and considerations for privacy and surveillance.

In this presentation, we discuss the strategies, successes, and challenges of engaging in collaborative open education resource development in a project where the main collaborators were settlers who wanted to engage deeply in reconciliation. This presentation describes our journey and the ways we engaged with a variety of stakeholders to ethically, thoughtfully, and care-fully produce our resource. A main aspect of our discussion will be around how we engaged in collaboration, community discussion, and sought outside authority with Indigenous experts. We discuss our own experiences with cultural humility and alternative ways of knowing. We are not speaking as experts with deep roots and relationships in the communities we engaged with; instead, we are speaking as newcomers and settlers engaged in this work and struggling with how to do it better. Indeed, this discussion will be about some of the strategies we tried and the lessons we learned and want to take forward to future projects. 10:00-10:30 | Artificial Intelligence Writing in Higher Education: A Teaching and Learning Centre Perspective | Practice Emily Ballantyne | Mount Saint Vincent University Abstract The launch of ChatGPT has caused seismic shift in the field of higher education. Amidst calls to ban it from schools and decrying the end of entire disciplines (Thomas 2023; Herman 2022; Vincent 2023, Stokel-Walker 2022), there have also been great surges of enthusiasm and optimism as faculty and students alike contend with how this will shape their educational experience going forward. The current crisis caused by artificially intelligence text generators is primarily pedagogical: how does this tool change how we approach learning? This presentation will explore the emerging issue of artificially intelligent writing from the perspective of a Teaching and Learning Centre. With a mission to support faculty across multiple disciplines engaged in assessment and feedback, it is our job (and our pleasure!) to help source solutions for common teaching problems. In the case of ChatGPT, however, targeted evidence-based strategies have yet to be developed. At the same time, the conversations about the tool are highly charged and fuelled by intensive media coverage of varying quality, all produced extremely quickly and often written to be highly inflammatory and fearmongering. Within our context, this means that in addition to providing accurate and useful information, we also need to work to decode and determine disinformation. It is our role to help apply the existing scholarship of teaching and learning to this new and novel problem. It is also our role to listen and disseminate the lived experience of faculty and students engaged with this work. Further, it is our role to be co-creators of this new knowledge as we work alongside our faculty peers to help, through trial and error, navigate this new educational landscape we find ourselves in.

Abstract Digital Education in an Age of Data: What Do We Do Now? What does the current digital ecosystem of pervasive digital surveillance, data mining, and encroaching AI mean for the participatory possibilities of open pedagogy and digital learning? What constitutes a critical, ethical response to this increasingly colonizing and extractive ecosystem? Drawing on two core – and potentially contradictory – patterns of change that intersect in digital learning right now, this talk will focus on the the ethical quandary this intersection creates for open and digital education. On one side are the relational, participatory open digital practices that utilize the infrastructure of the web to engage learners in knowledge abundance. On the other is the datafication of higher education and the resultant enclosure of the platforms on which open practices occur, by data-extractive and even predatory corporate entities. The session will examine how the rise of datafied tools and AI demands a critical and ethical response, but one that our contemporary ‘click yes’ culture makes extremely difficult to mount. It will outline the logics of market capture and hype that currently shape narratives around digital tools, and the barriers this creates for the development of genuine, critical, agential data and AI literacies among faculty and students. The session is designed to raise questions rather than offer answers, but will highlight two current digital classroom projects that the presenter uses to try to bridge the tensions noted above. These projects aim to foster open practices and data literacies among pre-service teachers, and to encourage them to see their roles as knowledge workers in a new light. The talk will invite participants to consider our mutual – if always differential – responsibility to approach digital and open education with a critical eye to the complex and often potential harmful digital ecosystems on which it relies, while still aiming to foster spaces for participatory learning, open sharing, and change. Ultimately, it will call for a sector-wide ethics approach to datafication, and invite input on what that could look like. Parallel Session 10.2 Life Sciences Building LSB 105 Session Link GO-GN (Global OER Graduate Network) Panel Researching at the Edge of Openness: Reflections from GO-GN Members Abstract GO-GN, the Global OER Graduate Network, brings together a core group of current doctoral researchers working on open education topics, along with the GO-GN team at the Open University, alumni, other researchers and fellow travellers through open space. And though we travel without uniforms or transporters, like members of Starfleet GO-GNers do go boldly, attempting to push the boundaries of knowledge in the field. Recognising the multiple senses in which education can be open, we approach the concept of openness from various angles and use a range of methods. In this panel discussion members of the network will reflect upon the what, why and how of their doctoral journeys, and invite session participants into our conversation.

However, many institutions have not fully embraced these technologies to empower their faculty and students to create, collaborate, and share their work online. A combination of Domain of One’s Own and Pressbooks may offer a solution to this problem by providing faculty and students with the tools and structure that they need to create and publish online in a way that is both secure, scalable and not out of reach for all but the most digitally fluent. In this presentation, we will explore the benefits of combining the practice of Domain of One’s Own with the use of an institutional Pressbooks instance. These benefits include: - Providing faculty and students with a platform for creating and sharing their work online in a way that focuses on ease of use. - Empowering faculty and students to take control of their learning by creating a personal e-book that reflects the growth of their learning throughout their program. - Allowing faculty to create and publish open educational resources (OERs) and other digital resources that can be used by students and other educators around the world. - Supporting the creation of online communities of practice and collaboration, where faculty and students can share their work, exchange ideas, and provide feedback. The presentation will be targeted towards faculty, instructional designers, librarians, and educational technologists who are interested in exploring this approach to teaching, learning, and research. Attendees will learn about the benefits of simplifying Domain of One’s Own with Pressbooks.

In efforts to slow the spread of the virus, many schools abruptly transitioned to emergency remote teaching (ERT). Not all teachers and students were familiar with using such tools, but were required to adapt. COVID-19 has resulted in a large amount of research in education; however, studies focused on ERT and its impact on teacher practice is limited. This inquiry explores how ERT has impacted digital technology usage in current K-12 teacher practice. Data has been collected from K-12 teachers enrolled in graduate programs at one large university through an online questionnaire, semi structured interviews, a review of documents provided by interview participants, and analytic memos. Analysis and interpretation of findings is in progress, and will be organized by way of examining the key research questions through Cultural Historical Activity Theory. This research will also reveal digital technologies introduced during ERT, and factors influencing a teacher’s decision to integrate new technologies into current practice. The author will conclude by offering recommendations that may be useful in the work of technological change in K-12 education.

In the wake of the Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) response to COVID-19, however the issues of data risk and privacy that these tools raise in classroom contexts have been minimally addressed for researchers, educators, and students. Additionally, while the ERT online pivot experience was generally global, digital classroom tools and their provenance vary. Many educational technology platforms are developed in the U.S yet used in other countries and jurisdictions. Yet multiple alternate educational technology markets exist in the contemporary world. This paper was designed to explore whether global claims about the potential privacy risks of classroom tools could be made and aims to analyze the policy documents of two popular tools in separate markets: Zoom, developed in the U.S., and ClassIn, developed in China. The paper provides a brief comparison of the relative data risks of these two prominent online classroom platforms. Similarities and distinctions between the two in terms of data transparency, safety, security, protection, rights, and contexts are outlined, but overall, for educators’ purposes, the findings suggest that data privacy implications of Zoom and ClassIn are more similar than they are different.

This fills another gap experienced by the Francophone community in Ontario, namely the lack of experiential learning opportunities in Francophone and bilingual environments. Once the match is made on the platform, stakeholders have access to built-in project management and communication tools, which facilitate collaboration. Although this project is specifically aimed at these institutions, the possibilities are endless and borderless allowing students to have an enriching and diverse experience, and on the other hand, employers around the world have access to the next generation of talent. Teachers and employers now have an equal chance to become major players in bridging the gap between theory and practice, education and work. 4:30-5:00 | Open at the Crossroads: Forging Media and Digital Literacy Pathways | Research Helen DeWaard | Lakehead University &amp; University of British Columbia Abstract In order to re-envision open and online education, and respond to the conference theme of Reckonings and Reimaginings, this session will focus on reckonings with digital technologies and media production in Canadian faculties of education to support a vision of open learning ecospheres while reimagining Marshall McLuhan’s prophetic words “the medium is the message” (McLuhan, 1977). In current times, educators in open and online educational spaces stand at a crossroads, facing media and digital directions and pathways toward uncertain futures. This presentation will begin by exploring past assemblages of media and digital literacies definitions and practices that impact decisions to navigate into the open. Then possible futures for online education are shared. The presenter provides perspectives and directions toward possibilities emerging from their research. The session will conclude with a collaborative and participatory mapping and wayfinding activity to investigate potential pathways toward forging new media and digital trails while exploring uncharted open ecologies together.

Virtual reality offer the potential to see and interact with concepts that are invisible or unreachable in a way that students are actively engaged in their learning and have been shown to positively contribute to motivation, engagement and learning. However, these effects are highly dependant on the pedagogical scenario. In this talk, we will present results from a large scale design-based research that brought together 38 teachers and 5 579 students. Using multilevel regression models, we observed that the level of complexity of the pedagogical scenario is a significant level 2 predictor of behavioral engagement. Pedagogical practices associated with high quality pedagogical scenarios will be contrasted with practices associated with low quality pedagogical scenarios and the results of qualitative interviews with students. Moreover, we will present a multicase study on professional development that shows that teachers participating in the project reported significant changes in their pedagogical practice occurring over time converged towards pedagogical scenarisation and active learning. 4:30-5:00 | A Gamified Design Framework to Enhance L2 Learners’ Motivation and Engagement | Research Mourad Majdoub | Université Laval Abstract Gamification has been the subject of extensive research as it potentially allows second/foreign language learners to enhance their language learning and, at the same time, foster their motivation and engagement (Koivisto &amp; Hamari, 2019). The reason is that several game elements, embedded in the gamified environments, can increase learners’ interest, can reduce learners’ anxiety and fear of speaking foreign language in front of others, and finally can encourage them to attain a favorable type of learning behavior (Dehghanzadeh et al., 2021). Since gamification is a relatively new concept, and most of the suggested gamified design frameworks are not based on solid theoretical foundations, it is not yet possible to fully understand its effect on the L2 learning process. Thus, the present communication aims at identifying a gamified design framework that would enhance learners’ motivation and engagement in their L2 classes. We have conducted a L2 gamified experiment with high school students where they have been observed interacting with their teacher and pairs. The field notes and a follow-up focus group interview will be qualitatively analysed to suggest a design framework for gamified L2 learning. Preliminary findings will be available in spring 2023, and will be shared at OTESSA conference.

In spite of institutional demands that we “get back to normal”, there is no going back. There is only going forward. We are at a pivotal point in defining what the future of education could be. Is this future bleak and dystopian? Or is it one of hope and radical change? This session invites instructors, academic staff, students, or others involved in the relational practice of teaching and learning to reflect on, challenge, and rewrite the stories that shape emerging practices in education. We will examine how identity and pedagogy are complex and sociomaterial, similar to a game of Cat’s Cradle, consisting of multiple strands, knots, and tensions (Haraway, 1994). Using entangled storytelling, we will explore this web of knotted influences, revealing hidden values, motivations and assumptions in education. We will then engage in speculative storytelling by reflecting on what could happen if we cut one thread or undo one knot, or if a new knot is tied or more strands are introduced. By engaging in both entangled and speculative storytelling, this session will open up new ways of thinking about and practicing education.

Life Sciences Building LSB 103 3:30-4:00 | Reviewing the Strengths and Challenges to Peer Review | Research Connie Blomgren | Athabasca University Abstract Along with many other aspects of research and the academy, there is some discussion of the role, function, strengths and challenges of peer review. Although double-blind peer review is the most accepted process for submissions to research journals changes are afoot. In addition to open reviews other changes are being experimented with various journals. With the advances to artificial intelligence and implications for all forms of writing, including scholarly documents, there is a timeliness to reassessing the strengths and challenges to peer review. Viewed within Hegarty’s Open Pedagogy framework and open access articles as one type of open educational resource, peer review takes on a more complex role within the move toward educational change. 4:00-4:30 | A Review of Research on Open education Adoption in higher Education: Exploring Approaches, Readiness, and Methods for Evaluation | Research Life Sciences Building LSB 103 Michael Paskevicius &amp; Valerie Irvine | University of Victoria Abstract The University of Victoria has recently received internal funding to develop the UVic Open Hub. This will be a portal for fostering a community to support open education dialogue, collaboration, and initiatives across the campus, including open teaching and learning resources, sharing approaches to open teaching, and open scholarship. As UVic is not the first to engage in such a project, we will share the results of a literature review that explores a) institutional approaches to expanding adoption of open education, b) faculty readiness to engage with open, and c) evaluation methods used to measure impact. As well, we hope to engage the audience in learning how they have experienced institutional initiatives towards open education and collaboratively develop a set of strategies and approaches for sharing. The goal of the UVic Open Hub is to shift culture to increase the availability, access, reuse, and redistribution of knowledge artifacts and to support the participation of stakeholders, including undergraduate and graduate students, staff, faculty, and administrators, in areas spanning research (open access, open scholarship, open data), teaching and learning (open education, open pedagogy, open educational resources), and service (connecting open practices for community engagement, marketing, and recruitment). Taking an expansive approach that goes beyond the creation and adoption of open educational resources we hope to develop a culture of open scholarship using a bottom-up approach by engaging with individual academic units. 4:30-5:00 | Research? Which Research? Technology, Assessment, and Higher Education in Tension | Research Life Sciences Building LSB 103 Colin Madland | University of Victoria Abstract Utilizing Bower’s technology-mediated learning theory as a framework, participants will be invited to engage in generative conversation about possible approaches to resolving the problem of fragmented and siloed bodies of literature related to technology-integrated assessment in higher education. Technology-integrated assessment practices in higher education are under scrutiny with another ‘existential threat’ in the form of automated text-generation. For those whose disciplines require extensive writing or coding, this has led to a certain lament regarding what appears to be at risk: the ability to trust that learners have engaged in the cognitive work of sense-making and are presenting the results of that work. In my own observations and in the process of reviewing the literature on technology-integrated assessment in higher education, responses to this development seem to map to distinct bodies of literature with weak connections between them. Responses seem to be oriented towards technology, assessment approaches, or individual disciplinary perspectives. The links between these siloed bodies of literature and on-the-ground difficulties in reacting to challenges to technology-integrated assessment in higher education will be problematized and explored and participants will engage in conversation to spark and sustain positive change for the good of the academy and society.

This is of particular importance for professional certification courses where group work is used to develop skills needed to prepare students for their chosen field, such as K-12 education. As part of case study research, the authors synthesize findings collected from both instructors and students at Western Canadian post-secondary institutions offering online courses in their Bachelor of Education degree pathways. Seeking to understand how group work can be designed to build essential professional skills required in the teaching profession through online course delivery, data was collected through one online survey, semi-structured interviews, and course documents. Findings suggest four design considerations for online group work: (1) clearly articulate the purpose of group work, (2) provide learner support through teaching presence, (3) be intentional in how groups are established, and (4) leverage digital tools for collaboration. The results will serve to benefit faculty, students and educational policy makers in understanding how group learning in online courses can be designed to develop critical professional skills. This will particularly benefit post-secondary institutions providing online courses in professional fields. 10:00-10:30 | The Landscape of Merging Modalities | Practice Valerie Irvine | University of Victoria Abstract On today’s higher education campus, there are likely a dozen new terms being used to describe different configurations around the modality of courses. Modality typically refers to the location and timing of interactions. What used to be a simple binary of face-to-face or online has now become so extremely complex that our ability to understand each other is impaired. In this session, I will discuss a recent paper I published in the Educause Review, entitled The Landscape of Merging Modalities, including the history of modality, merging modality terminology, the struggles with semantics, and pedagogy vs. modality. I will close with practical steps that individuals and institutions can take to make strong planning and pedagogical decisions that also take into account instructor workload and care for the learner.

When difference translates to diminished access, participation and outcomes, then these inequities need to be understood in order to be addressed, particularly in schools. In a post-digital era, surveillance has enabled injustices to be recorded and distributed, acutely raising awareness of the many forms of systemic oppression in Canadian society. For these reasons, the study of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) is important in post-secondary education as the K-12 curriculum in Canadian schools can be silent on some of these topics. Designers of courses in EDI need to engage both the students who are already aware that education and society are unequal and those who are not. Through the process of learning about the unequal aspects of education, it can be challenging to keep students engaged. In addition, the designers of EDI courses need to teach EDI in a way that the key concepts, theories and discourses across areas of difference coalesce to make sense and reinforce learning. In this session, students who designed foundational courses in EDI at both the graduate and undergraduate level for their Faculty of Education address the different backgrounds, perspectives and goals that they brought to the process of course design. As they co-created the course, they came to realize that there were multiple areas of oppression and had to grapple with which areas to address first. Different theoretical approaches to the teaching of EDI in the past have created separate spaces rather than common understandings of inequality. The study of critical race theory is unlikely to open spaces for broader gender expression. An understanding of intersectionality can bring a realization of the compounding effects when sites of oppression intersect, but it is insufficient as a pedagogical approach to address all of the ways that students can be “othered” in a school system. This created a challenge for the student designers to discern how areas of inequality in schools were similar and how they differed. Working in a digitally-fluent educational program, the students worked together to create online courses. They looked for ways to build social presence and cognitive presence within the online space. They realized that the teaching of EDI is not a process of conversion but a process of hearing other perspectives and understanding educational inequality through others’ eyes. Some had experienced inequities as members of equity-seeking groups; others were coming to terms with an understanding of systematic forms of oppression; and still others wanted to work toward critical, decolonizing and transformative pedagogical approaches. As a group, they developed a collective understanding of what is needed to prepare students to understand how Canadian workplaces and schools can become sites of increased EDI awareness and change.

As the COVID-19 pandemic prompted exponential growth in online teamwork, skills for online collaborative problem-solving have become essential for today’s graduates. As such, online collaborative testing can play a crucial role in supporting students to develop these skills. In this paper, we report on how an online collaborative test was implemented in a large first-year undergraduate course. We will begin with a review of the literature on online collaborative testing. We then describe how the instructional team designed and administered a synchronous online collaborative midterm exam in which groups worked together to analyze a complex case scenario. Finally, we will conclude with a reflection on the strengths and limitations of our approach and opportunities for future design. 10:00-10:30 | Hidden Curriculum of Education Technologies | Practice Danielle Dilkes | Western University Abstract This session will offer participants an opportunity to reflect on the digital spaces in which learning occurs and on how these spaces constrain and afford student and instructor behaviour through designs that invisibly embody specific values, motivations, beliefs and assumptions about education. We will examine different designs for learning environments, including the carceral designs, or hostile architectures, common to many educational technologies such as Learning Management Systems, surveillance technologies and other digital tools. We will also examine tools that emphasize learner autonomy by allowing a distribution of control and how these designs reflect a different belief about teaching and learning. Because many of the values and beliefs embedded in these designs are hidden, we will consider how certain designs may control how instructors teach, how learners learn, and the relationship between instructors and learners. We will conclude with a pragmatic discussion of how to strike balance between the convenience of certain technologies and the importance of fostering the digital literacies required to identify tools that align with our own ideologies and pedagogical identities.

Nick Bertrand | University of Calgary Abstract Education as a tool for both healing and reconciliation has been an evolving movement over the years, and in particular since the release the of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 94 Calls to Action. Eight years later in a post TRC society, what truths remain untold? What lessons have we learned in trying to mobilize meaningful change? How can we as educators, uphold our responsibilities in the work of rebuilding the broken relationship that has brought us to this space? As the reconciliatory bridge continues to be constructed, education systems will continue to play a keystone role in the process of building awareness, understanding, and creating action.

Currently, we are missing the opportunity to collectively have a voice as system shifts are occurring that impact the design and support of online and open education. I will provide examples of different pathways for advocacy, such as briefs to leadership within an institution or province government. I will review the process for provincial or federal pre-budget submissions; how to examine mandate letters for ministerial leaders; and invite participants to write or meet with your local representative (e.g., MLA for a provincial representative or MP for federal representative) to amplify work being done. We also have a session on June 2 regarding changes needed in the federal tri-agency for funding research as there are systemic biases against education, let alone educational technology. After an overview of these options, we will invite you to contribute ideas that will form OTESSA’s federal pre-budget submission later this summer.

Our main research question was: To what extent, if at all, are postsecondary professors, librarians, and lecturers adopting OEPs in Francophone minority settings in Canada?  Three themes were generated in our thematic analyses. The adoption or non-adoption of OEPs in minority Francophone settings in Canada appears to be related to 1) Limited knowledge and application of OEPs, 2) inadequate support, and 3) the potential of PEOs at the post-secondary level in minority Francophone settings.  The themes and sub-themes give us a good overview of the challenges of OEP integration present at the time of the study, both in terms of the sociolinguistic context and the level of knowledge of open education. The voices of the participants also highlighted the potential impact of the open movement in a minority language context.  More research on marginalized language groups is needed to explore the potential of OEP to sustain inclusive, equitable, and positive change in the open education landscape.

The goal was to provide Internet access to low-income families across Canada. At the turn of the millennium, the Internet has become an essential tool for accessing information and knowledge. Yet Canada, like many other countries around the world, faces accessibility challenges for multiple reasons: geography, culture, history, etc. (Howard et al., 2018). In this sense, technology gaps have developed in relation to age, language, family income, origin, etc. Howard et al. (2018) point out that education, age, and income are correlated with limited internet access and low digital literacy. The survey sent out consisted of 30 questions addressing: sociodemographic characteristics, accessible digital resources, habits with technology, initiative needs, and Internet uses and challenges. A total of 89,776 questionnaires (P1 = 28,444; P2 = 9,163; P3 = 34,327; P4 = 17,842) were completed by participants in the initiative. In addition to the questionnaire, interviews were conducted during each phase with a variable number of participants (between 20 and 50) to clarify ideas. Longitudinal results shed light on the impact of such an initiative on low-income families, as well as on the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the habits of an at-risk group.

Educators need to rethink existing teaching approaches to better prepare learners for future careers that Industry 4.0 will create. The World Economic Forum defined a new education model, called Education 4.0, which contains eight major changes to redefine learning in the new economy. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is an approach that promotes critical thinking, social-emotional skills, and life-long learning. These skills are necessary for Education 4.0. The purpose of this paper is to recommend the principles of heutagogy as an effective teaching and learning approach to meet the needs of Education 4.0. The approach of the study examines existing literature on Education 4.0 and heutagogy. A conceptual model that interconnects heutagogy to the four learning principles of Education 4.0 will be offered as a key finding to answer the research question: How does heutagogy in higher online education meet the needs of Education 4.0? The paper provides a base for further research and discussion into how heutagogy and other approaches can support the needs of Education 4.0 to prepare learners for a changing world. 4:30-5:00 | An Interwoven Course: Reflective Practice and Portfolio | Practice Christine Ho Younghusband | University of Northern British Columbia Abstract A teacher education program in British Columbia (BC) redesigned the curriculum to include an interwoven course that would span over the 16-months of the program to develop the teacher candidate’s reflective practice through inquiry and e-portfolios. The program used to be a 2-year program and provide a 3-credit EdTech course in the third term of four as a discrete course. In that course, creating an e-Portfolio would have been one of the learning objectives. In this interwoven course, however, teacher candidates are exposed to developing an open-sourced WordPress site in the first term with guidance from faculty, but over time, teacher candidates become more autonomous and independent with content creation as they develop their reflective practice, engage in inquiry on a topic of interest in education, and make explicit connections between theory and practice while meeting the expectations of the Professional Standards for BC Educators. Writing through blogging and creating webpages that best depict who the teacher candidate perceives their strengths and competencies as an educator provides a platform to personalize their learning and sense-make between theory and practice.

As the World Economic Forum Jobs 2020 report (2020) noted, there is an increasing need to provide short-timeframe opportunities for re-skilling and upskilling that will not diminish as we move forward. Micro-credentials have been proposed as a strategy to enable the ongoing development of knowledge and skills across the workforce, which we examine in the context of a university initiative that has prototyped skill pathways to address key climate adaptation themes, including the use of Indigenous knowledge and world views as a critical lens for analysis and action. We report and discuss the strategic use of the Climate Adaptation Competency Framework (2020) – a CC-licensed open competency framework – along with the use of open educational resources to create agile pathways to skill development. The pathways we have designed and are testing combine self-directed learning resources, individual and group activities, and authentic assessment practices to validate skill development. Micro-credentials are awarded from a university continuing and professional learning division to professionals from multiple practice domains for demonstrations of competence. 4:30-5:00 | What Happened to OpenCourseWare? A Discussion of the Open Education Movement’s Shift from Course Content to Textbooks | Practice Erik Christiansen | Mount Royal University Abstract The open education movement is now more than twenty years old, if counting from the launch of MIT’s OpenCourseWare (OCW) in 2001. Though OCW was instrumental in jumpstarting higher education’s enthusiasm for open educational resources (OER), provincial funding bodies have doubled-down on open textbooks, and this focus is reflected in the language used by provincial funding bodies, as well as the impressive, and growing, number of openly licensed textbooks. The focus on textbooks is understandable given the intense interest from students. Several provincial funding bodies, including BC Campus, OpenEd Manitoba, and eCampus Ontario have saved students millions of dollars by encouraging open textbook adoption in post-secondary. Furthermore, open textbooks (and other learning objects) are arguably easier to host and distribute than entire courses. The tradeoff is that this lopsided focus on open textbooks means that a few institutions (most notably MIT, TU Delft and others) dominate the OCW space. In this presentation, the author will argue the reasons why OCW investment is inconsistent and highlight the challenges that face OCW creation and adoption. The author will also argue that refocusing on OCW investment has the potential to bolster institutional reputation and satisfy a public that is hungry for high-quality open content.

Community-based researchers are doing this foundational work, conducting research alongside community partners. This work often results in non-traditional research outputs including, for instance, reports, policy briefs, photographic exhibits, and video productions. While this work serves to inform policy, advance social change, and by extension, contribute to teaching and learning, it is often not shared widely online in ways that encourage discoverability, and long-term use. Notably, it is frequently absent from digital platforms maintained by academic libraries used to distribute scholarly and creative works in open and sustainable ways such as institutional repositories and open-source web-publishing applications, and it is rarely shared under flexible Creative Commons copyright licenses. Reflecting on recent data collected through surveys and interviews with Canadian community-based researchers and librarians supporting scholarly communications, this presentation will provide insight into why this work is so often not shared on open access platforms. Participants will be asked to consider challenges and opportunities present at their own institutions to support the dissemination of community-based research outputs, with a particular focus on reimagining academic library services to help advance its impact and reach. 4:00-4:30 | The Role of Teachers’ Assessment Literacy in an Inquiry-Based Learning Environment | Research Maryam Shirdel Pour &amp; Michael Paskevicius | University of Victoria Abstract Assessment literacy is defined as the knowledge and expertise that are employed to conduct valid assessments (Luthfiyyah et al., 2020). Research indicates that teachers’ assessment literacy could influence the effectiveness of educational practices (Oo et al., 2022). Teachers with adequate assessment literacy support learners to enhance their understanding and achieve desired learning outcomes. Inquiry-based learning is defined as an educational approach that emphasizes student agency and their active role in knowledge creation often using digital tools and technologies. Creating a learning environment that encourages learners to pursue knowledge through their inquiries and construct understanding while participating in learning activities fosters student learning (Vaughn et al., 2022). Moving toward inquiry-based learning necessitates some adjustments in the approaches that educators apply to assess learners as they document the progress of their learning in an open manner. Teachers can benefit from developing assessment literacy to teach more efficiently, address learners’ educational needs, and evaluate their learning process. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature to gain a deeper understanding of the influence of teachers’ assessment literacy while conducting assessments in a technology-enabled inquiry-based learning environment. Moreover, the challenges teachers may confront while implementing the inquiry-based assessment will be discussed.

Participants will explore the tool’s interdisciplinary applications and create non-linear stories. From feminist perspectives, Twine is an accessible and free digital tool that, by having a low learning curve (Anthropy, Evans), “challenges mainstream standards by subverting the celebration of difficulty, in both production and play” (Harvey). The workshop explores Twine as a tool for otherwise thinking and shaping future possibilities, guided by the questions: How might Twine as an interactive story-telling tool create opportunities for participants to use the written word? How might these engagements enable new kinds of experiences and meaning-making for learners? We aim to facilitate exploration into how non-linearity can be reflective of Black feminist, anti-colonial, and plural forms of futurism and design. We do not position Twine as a technological fix, but a tool to generate expansive thinking; engage in collaborative digital scholarship; and craft new meanings. Our facilitators draw from their areas of study and pedagogical perspectives (digital cultures; communications; gender, feminist and women’s studies; creative writing) to demonstrate the tool’s cross-disciplinary applications.

There has always been concerns about possible bias, stereotyping and impact of categorization of students. Students’ (data)(learning) privacy were somewhere to be found among files being carried from one office to the other, files that got misplaced, unlocked storages and, possibly, a laissez-faire approach to protecting student data privacy because what happened in the classroom and school, stayed in the classroom (mostly). Even if this portrayal of student data privacy may sound idealistic and rather, simplistic, we must reckon how the increasing digitalization and datafication of teaching and learning changes not only the scope of student (data) privacy, but also attempts to protect their (and our) data. In this presentation I hope to provoke thinking about the (un)bearable lightness of student data privacy and consider what it means for students, faculty, institutional data governance amid the intensification and expansion of the data gaze.

Break | 1:15-1:30 Concurrent Session 18 | 1:30-3:00 1.5 Hours Concurrent Session 18.1 | Transitions of Online Learning &amp; Teaching Session Link 1:30-2:30 | Assessment in a Digital Age: Learning within the Continuum for Pedagogy, Technology, and Assessment | Workshop Barbara Brown &amp; Nadia Delanoy | University of Calgary Jodie Walz | Calgary Catholic School District Abstract As a result of an observation that preservice teachers and in-service teachers need more hands-on opportunities to engage in digital assessment practices to prepare for more technology-enhanced learning environments, a research and practice collaboration emerged between a faculty of education and school district educational technologists. This design-based study involved designing an online professional learning series aimed to develop teachers’ formative and summative assessment practices using technology enhanced practices. Through engaging participants in reflection and time to engage with technology-enhanced methods, we used a theory to practice design as well as the TPACK framework to explore the relationship between: (1) technology, (2) teaching pedagogy, and (3) content knowledge. The results from this study demonstrated the importance of designing assessment through an interconnected lens prioritizing the centricity of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge. Additionally, the research indicated participant efficacy when engaging in pedagogical applications of assessment with technological constructs suited to their teaching and learning environments. The complexities afoot within the duration of this work spanned not only the beginning of the pandemic but now the realities embedded in an emerging post-pandemic context. 2:30-3:00 | Reflections on an Emerging National Strategy for Open Education | Report Bradley Wuetherick | University of British Columbia – Okanagan Campus Valerie Irvine | University of Victoria Ann Ludbrook | Toronto Metropolitan University Abstract Over the past decade, higher education institutions, organizations, and governments have advocated for, and invested in, open education – particularly focusing on the ways open education can mitigate ongoing accessibility and affordability concerns. And while there have been a number of initiatives to coordinate these activities, there has not been a national strategy for open education in Canada. Over the past two years, Open Education advocates (faculty, librarians, administrators, and representatives of organizations across the country) have begun meeting to work towards the development of a national Open Education strategy. To further this work, they have worked together to host one National Summit with two additional Summits to follow, focusing on francophone OER, and the intersection of Indigenous Knowledges and OERs. This session will focus on the reflections of four individuals involved in these national conversations, focusing on the impetus behind the development of a national Open Education strategy, the importance of the three Summits (already hosted or planned), and why the development of a national strategy is a priority for Canadian higher education. Concurrent Session 18.2 | Transitions of Online Learning &amp; Teaching Session Link 1:30-2:00 | Open Education Research: Past, Present, Future | Research Robert Farrow, Beck Pitt, Martin Weller, Paco Iniesto &amp; Carina Bossu | The Open University Abstract The Global OER Graduate Network (GO-GN, n.d.) supports doctoral research in open education around the world and currently has several hundred members who are doctoral/post-doctoral researchers and interested expert practitioners. In this presentation we offer some analysis of trends in research into open education, drawing on the data generated by GO-GN as well as other expert research. We provide an analysis of network activity and identify core areas for contemporary open education research, including open practice, OER as a discipline area, making connections between research clusters and the application of OER in non-traditional learning contexts. We also offer some reflections on the evolving nature of discourse around open education and the relation between research and practice, particularly around the themes of social justice and equity, diversity and inclusion. 2:00-2:30 | Using Qualitative Online Survey as a Research Method Amid Covid Pandemic | Practice Yina Liu | University of Alberta Abstract Online survey becomes one of the popular/favorite methods for conducting research under the Covid-19 pandemic. The method allows researchers to collect data without in-person interaction, also provides convenient processes for both researchers and participants to engage a survey in terms of delivering surveys and giving responses. However, the actual situations in data collection may not be described as convenient. This paper will present an autoethnography study of a researcher’s own experiences of conducting qualitative online survey during Covid-19 in Canada. The researcher used online qualitative survey to explore newcomer children’s digital literacy practices and their parents’ perspectives towards digital practices. This presentation will provide suggestions for future survey researchers, in terms of effective strategies of collecting data. 2:30-3:00 | Technological Distance: A New Way of Conceptualizing the “Distance” in Distance Learning | Research Jon Dron | Athabasca University Abstract This paper presents the concept of technological distance, which describes a gap between technologies (broadly defined to include methods, tools, principles, and processes) available for a learner to learn, and those needed to complete that learning. This gap is a measure of both the participation and autonomy of learners in the process. Available technologies may include those provided by teachers and institutions as well as from many others, most notably including the learners themselves. The technologies that make up the assembly are only components, however. What matters most is how learners fill the gaps between them to achieve their learning goals. These are fundamentally situated, idiosyncratic, and human. Technological distance provides new insights into other models that use spatial metaphors, such as the presences of communities of inquiry and transactional distance. Concurrent Session 18.3 | Wildcard Session Link 1:30-2:00 | Non-Directive Strength-Based Online Coaching in Graduate Education | Research Carolyn Kristjansson | Trinity Western University Abstract Online and blended modes of graduate education have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, often resulting in online learning spaces comprised of adult learners with a wide range of life experiences from diverse cultural contexts and language backgrounds. A key consideration is how best to support such learners to facilitate a sense of belonging and engagement (Jeng, Bosch, &amp; Perry, 2023), conditions some researchers consider fundamental to academic success (Roddy, et al., 2017). One possibility is through coaching. This presentation reports on the initial results from a case study investigating students’ experience of non-directive strength-based online coaching support in a Master’s in Teaching English to Speakers of other Languages (MA TESOL) program. The case study is guided by theoretical understandings of the learning environment as a complex dynamic system (Dornyei, 2014) and coaching as a social practice (Author) that can be characterized by positive or negative emotional attractor states (Boyatzis, Rochford, &amp; Taylor, 2015). The presentation provides an overview of preliminary quantitative and qualitative analysis to illuminate the value of the online coaching experience from the perspective of graduate students who were coached. 2:30-3:00 | The Teacher’s Self-efficacy and Belief in Implementing S STEM, iSTEM or STEAM in their Classroom | Research Atiya Razi | University of Windsor Abstract In recent years, STEM, iSTEM (Integrated STEM), and STEAM (STEM paradigms) have revolutionized the educational paradigm. Researchers, educators, and professionals globally consider STEM paradigms their saviours (Kuenzi, 2008), which have reckoned and reimagined the educational archetype. This study is grounded in Bandura’s self-efficacy theory and socio-cultural constructivist learning theories. Successful STEM, iSTEM, and STEAM delivery are linked to the teachers’ self-efficacy and beliefs in their classroom because it motivates students, develop a positive attitude toward STEM subjects, and enhance students’ 21st-century competency (Kanadlı, S., 2019). This study aims to fill a research gap by examining teachers’ perspectives on STEM paradigms and their integration together by exploring current and past pedagogies. Researchers and educators will also benefit from this study by exploring teachers’ challenges when implementing STEM paradigms in their classrooms. Finally, the study examines the factors that support teachers in implementing STEM paradigms in the classroom. A mixed-methods approach will be employed, involving surveys and interviews. The results from this study will offer a solid knowledge basis for interested students, educators, researchers, and policymakers with the strategies needed for the successful execution of STEM in school; professional development; generating and designing the education policy that supports STEM education, STEM career development, and the job market, especially in Canada. 2:30-3:00 | Leveraging Social Annotation in the Age of AI | Research Jessica Fuller | hypothes.is Abstract The emergence of cutting-edge technologies, like ChatGPT, has sparked a critical conversation throughout the world of education. In this session, Jessica from Hypothesis will show how to leverage social annotation to encourage authentic, process-oriented engagement with course materials. She’ll also share best practices for using social annotation with AI writing tools and demonstrate how to set up Hypothesis-enabled readings in your LMS. Participants can expect to leave the session armed with concrete assignment ideas to implement in courses right away. Concurrent Session 18.4 | Addressing Inequities Session Link 1:30-2:30 | Four Perspectives of Learner-Educator Co-Creation | Practice Mercedes Lock | Cambrian College Jane Tyerman | University of Ottawa Lillian Chumbley | Trent University Laura Killam | Queen’s University Canada Abstract In this panel discussion we will discuss the challenges and benefits of learner-educator co-creation from a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives. Our focus will be on answering the audience’s questions about learner-educator co-creation. We will also bring some common questions that we have received from others to begin the conversation should the audience need time to ponder their questions. Panelists will represent different aspects of co-creation across both academia and professional development uses. Panelists have experience implementing and supporting co-creation as learners, students, educators, partners and support staff in undergraduate and graduate courses, professional development, and industry contexts. The panel discussion will be supported by a virtual backchannel that will foster participant engagement in the discussion, allow for crowdsourcing of notes and materials, and asking of questions. Our hope is to create a meaningful discussion to support those who are new to co-creation or looking for ways to improve their co-creation practice. 2:30 - 3:00 | A Learner-Educator Co-Creation Toolkit | Practice Laura Killam | Queen’s University Canada Lillian Chumbley | Trent University Jane Tyerman | University of Ottawa Abstract Co-creation occurs when learners and educators work together to make decisions during a course. Shared decision-making may occur in relation to one or more components of a course such as content curation or designing assessments. This partnership has many potential benefits including student empowerment, promotion of improved relationships, and metacognition, but educators may be hesitant to try it because they are concerned about pragmatic limitations. These limitations may include the time involved, technical requirements, and engaging large classes. In addition, questions about academic integrity concerns may arise. In this presentation we share and seek collaboration on a drafted toolkit for learner-educator co-creation. Our goal is to provide a location where educators can easily access tools that will help them effectively engage in co-creation related to a spectrum of small to larger learning decisions. In this presentation we will discuss opportunities to improve this toolkit and engage in an ongoing community of practice. Concurrent Session 18.5 | Sustaining Positive Change 1:30 - 2:30 | Scaling Small: The Open Book Collective Launch and Platform | Practice Judith Fathallah | Lancaster University Abstract The Open Book Collective, scheduled to launch November 2022, brings together Open Access book publishers, scholarly librarians, and OA infrastructure providers, working towards a sustainable and equitable future for OA books. This session will introduce our work, then demonstrate the use of the Open Book Collective membership platform, which will be live by the time of the conference. The Open Book Collective operates according to the principle of Scaling Small, which has guided the work of its umbrella project, Community-Led Open Infrastructures for Open Access Books (COPIM). ‘Scaling Small’, as opposed to ‘scaling up’, is an alternative way of envisaging a publishing and distribution ecosystem for Open Access Books that is based on mutual reliance and other kinds of collaboration rather than competition and incorporation. We believe that economies of scale flatten community diversity and lead to unhealthy monopolies. More pragmatically, the OBC requires a commitment from our publisher members to move away from book processing charges, which are both unsustainable and deeply inequitable. The introduction and interactive demonstration will be followed by a Q and A. Break | 3:00-3:15 Social | 3:15-3:45 Session Link Music with Jon Dron Concurrent Session 19 | 3:45-5:15 1.5 Hours Concurrent Session 19.1 | Wildcard Session Link 3:45-4:45 | On Speculative Education Fiction for Hopeful Learning Futures | Research Shandell Houlden &amp; George Veletsianos | Royal Roads University Abstract In this session, we discuss reimagining education futures by examining the limits and potentialities of speculative research methods, with focus on the distinction in the literature between pessimistic visions of the future, which are visions exploring themes such as disconnection, lack of autonomy and sovereignty, and technological, corporate, state and/ or authoritarian control, and hopeful futures. Hopeful speculative education futures are shaped by themes such as connection, agency and community and individual flourishment, and suggest a turn to the genres of hopepunk, solarpunk and visionary fiction as models of speculative storytelling grounded in hope. A focus on these more liberatory futures serves to disrupt the over-reliance on pessimistic storytelling, which itself is related to apocalyptic storytelling, which risks reinforcing inequality, especially with respect to settler colonial injustice. 4:45-5:15 | Wait… What? Examining SSHRC Funding Structures and Processes With a Focus on its Implications on Equitable Access for Educational Researchers | Research Valerie Irvine | University of Victoria Sonja Johnston | University of Calgary Keywords: Abstract Access to federal government funding to support research in the social sciences has always been a highly competitive process for faculty and graduate students. As scholarship is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, we are observing challenges in terms of ensuring pathways to support a review process specifically for interdisciplinary research, while also ensuring equitable access to tri-agency funding across the three council (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)) as well as between disciplines on committees within SSHRC. As educational researchers, we have noted trends that put educational researchers, housed in Faculties of Education, at a possible disadvantage. We will also touch on the additional burden that marginalizes researchers and graduate students in educational technology, who face a “second shift” in terms of continually developing and updating digital literacies and online learning pedagogies. In this session, we will review publicly available data and share personal observations of the process, which includes direct experience as a repeated reviewer of SSHRC doctoral applications in Ottawa. We will share steps being taken to open dialogue and to make recommendations for next steps as we hope to collect data to inform recommendations for change. We welcome participants to provide input on strategies for creating change for fair access to funding for education. Concurrent Session 19.2 | Sustaining Positive Change Session Link 3:45-4:45 | “No Longer Silent!” Racialized Academic Women Speak Out | Research Sandra Dixon | University of Lethbridge Cecille DePass | University of Calgary Dawn Edge | The University of Manchester Mille Batta | University of Lethbridge Abstract Given that racialized academic women are impacted negatively in academia (Canadian Association of University Teachers [CAUT], 2018; National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2020), this research contributes directly to promoting positive changes in the academy and larger society. The research question explores: How can the scholarship and research for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) among racialized academic women enhance and strengthen multiple disciplines, policymaking and administration in academia? This inquiry aligns with OTESSA’s Mission to advance innovative research and disseminate data outcomes as part of knowledge mobilization. This session supports the conference’s theme since it aims to promote EDI in education, scholarship, and society. Grounded in research, this presentation lays the foundations for increased policy-making and institutional consciousness, inclusive community building, and cultural sensitivity within academia. The Intersectionality Theory that informs this work reveals a complex picture of the ways that racialized groups are othered in society (Crenshaw, 1989). Document analysis (Morgan, 2022), the methodological approach that underpins this research explores a first-person account of an individual’s actions, experiences, beliefs, and worldviews (Bowen, 2009). This session concludes with a call for action that offers concrete strategies to inform policy and practice provincially, nationally, and internationally. Attendees will be invited to explore thought-provoking questions and consider how they navigate racialized academic contexts. 4:45-5:15 | Peace Education in the Platformed Society: Lessons from Colombia | Research Estaban Morales | University of British Columbia Abstract In Colombia, peace education has been recognized as essential to changing prevailing violence narratives. And, as peace education seeks to respond to the lives and needs of citizens, it has become increasingly necessary to consider how peace and violence are transformed by digital platforms such as social media. Indeed, platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp have transformed how Colombians experience and interact with ecologies of violence that affect them and their communities. Accordingly, this paper will explore how reflection, dialogue, and imagination on violence on social media are venues of transformative learning. In this study, 18 Colombian young adults explored, discussed, and reflected on social media violence as they experienced it in their everyday lives. Results of this study show that critical conversations among peers can support young adults’ learning processes around both media literacies and peace education, where they can better identify, understand, and address harmful behaviour online and offline. Overall, this presentation highlights the need to incorporate digital environments into efforts to build and sustain cultures of peace. Concurrent Session 19.3 | Wildcard Session Link 3:45-5:15 | Designing Pedagogy for Immersive Experiences | Workshop Joannie Girard | Conseil scolaire Viamonde S Girouard | Conseil Scolaire Catholique Mon Avenir Lorayne Robertson | Ontario Tech University Abstract Virtual reality is a technology where users are immersed in a digital world created by a computer and accessed through a headset (Dalton, 2021). Virtual reality has been shown to enhance learning in healthcare and safety training because it simulates the real environment vividly. Early explorations of VR use in education show that it provides a cost-effective and visually-stimulating field trip experience that engages students in new ways. There are, however, other advantages to the use of VR and these are connected with the level of immersion that it affords the user. In an immersive VR setting, participants have autonomy to explore the virtual environment, interact with objects and other people, and create spaces suited to different learning needs. In the proposed workshop, participants will be able to access VR through their phones, computers or using a headset. The workshop employs Spatial, a software platform that facilitates real time collaboration in the virtual environment. This technology was recently used successfully for professional development for teachers in Ontario in geographically-remote French-language school districts. In this workshop, participants will gain a sense of co-presence in VR and see the potential for employing these polysynchronous learning spaces in education. Concurrent Session 19.4 | Sustaining Positive Change Session Link 3:45-4:15 | Discovery Based Learning with Open Technologies, for Positive Change | Practice Brian Sutherland | University of Toronto Abstract The fields of design and ubiquitious or pervasive computing underscore many academic disciplines – few have been unaffected by the design of systems, the advent of high speed communication capabilities and the proliferation of computing devices. Increasingly, these relations are facilitated by open frameworks and communities in hardware, software, and pedagogy. In this session I discuss a fourth year capstone course in digital design where students in groups engaged with open code libraries and small computers to create sensing devices and systems to aid positive change in healthcare, biology and/or the environment. It revives a pedagogy known as discovery-based learning where the outcome is uncertain, the problems – complex, and the knowledge – extensively articulated and emergent. Learners completed guided practicals mentored by other students, instructional staff, and online resources, supported by their search and evaluation skills, to scaffold their rapid development in a complex, in many cases previously unknown subject domain. The result wasn’t so much working prototypes as simulations of capability and a rich conceptual understanding of the underlying socio-technical systems of development, aided by twenty-first century skills such as search and critical evaluation of sources, online networking, group collaboration, and global citizenship for positive change. 4:15-4:45 | Interprofessional Healthcare Simulation Co-Creation: A Pilot Study | Research Laura Killam | Queen’s University Canada Jacqueline Vaughn, Alicia Sellon, Chase DuBois, Amelia Huelskamp, Andrea Smith, Colette Waddill &amp; Justine Reel | University of North Carolina Wilmington Abstract Background: Co-creation, interprofessional education, and simulation are strategies that may prepare healthcare students to manage real-world challenges in teams. Faculty identified both a desire to engage in collaboration with students and a need to leverage student creativity to aid in closing the gap in available resources on campus. Aim: In this presentation we share the results of a multi-method pilot study that aimed to test the development of a course wherein students partnered with faculty in a design challenge to co-create evidence-based interprofessional simulations. The focus of this study was to assess project feasibility and student perceptions of how the experience shaped their learning. Methods: The intervention was a three-day design challenge where students co-created a simulation with faculty in interprofessional groups. We measured interprofessional competencies before and after the intervention, collected open-ended feedback about student learning, and assessed feasibility (time requirements, resources) of students co-designing a simulation. Results: This strategy was found to be feasible, effective, unique, and valuable. Students expressed a desire for more learning similar to this experience. Conclusion: Learner-educator simulation co-creation may be a viable strategy to improve student interprofessional competencies and enrich learning. More research on a larger scale is needed. 4:45-5:15 | Negotiating an Informed Personal Theory and Philosophy of Open Education in a Professional Development Setting | Research Irwin DeVries | Royal Roads University Emily Schudel &amp; Kimberlee Carter | Kwantlen Polytechnic University Abstract This presentation is offered by three experienced higher education professionals who have an interest in open education. It is focused on their own practice as reflected in a professional development program they are taking, which is the setting for this presentation. This program focuses not only on the resources and techniques of open education, but also on the purposes and goals of open education, including questions of social justice. In this session the presenters will share reflections on their experience of the first course in the program, which is focused on theory and philosophy of open education. This course led participants through an exploration of histories, meanings and purposes of open education, while integrating literature, discussions and examples from participants’ own practice. A critically reflexive collaborative approach (Hamilton &amp; Pinnegar, 2014) is used to describe, compare and analyze their experiences. We approach these topics from the perspective that openness is “contextual, but it is also personal and continually negotiated” (Cronin, 2017. P. 8) and therefore we situate our understanding in within our individual practices. Break | 5:15-5:30 Concurrent Session 20 | Invited Speakers | 5:30-6:15 45 Minutes Concurrent Session 20.1 Session Link Nadia Naffi | Université Laval Embracing the Metaverse: FormationMeta and the Future of Immersive Learning Experiences (in French) Abstract Delve into the exciting world of FormationMeta, a groundbreaking 14-week exploratory project spearheaded by Laval University’s Chair in Educational Leadership on Innovative Pedagogical Practices in Digital Contexts – National Bank, in partnership with Laval University Library and OVA. This innovative project provided Laval University’s learning experience designers and instructors with an authentic experience to cultivate their skills in designing and developing immersive learning experiences within virtual reality and the metaverse. Engaging students from diverse disciplines such as educational technology, art, and game design, the project harnessed the power of StellarX.ai software to create bespoke immersive training tailored to the library’s clientele. Presented in French, this talk will unveil emerging recommendations to enlighten educational teams eager to embrace immersive learning experiences. The speaker will address pressing questions, including the current possibilities and future technological advancements, such as generative AI, essential skills for developing learning experiences in the metaverse, and strategies for training expert groups in education and educational technology to create immersive experiences that effectively cater to learner groups while adhering to ethical, equitable, and inclusive principles. Concurrent Session 20.2 Session Link Randy LaBonte | Vancouver Island University &amp; Canadian eLearning Network Design Principles for Digital Learning and NSQOL Standards: Commonalities &amp; Differences Abstract Join this session to gain an understanding of design and organization principles to help inform quality in K-12 online learning teacher and leader practices. Learn about the Canadian-based online learning design principles and their commonalities and differences to the US-based National Standards for Quality Online Learning (NSQOL), application to pedagogy and practice, and how the elucidation and clarification of design and organization principles help inform leadership and administrative policy for quality online learning.

Borders are a method that helps to redefine and reorganize our understanding of these spaces and the rules that importantly determine governance over moments of dispossession, marginalization, and exploitation. Indeed, the “digital divide” is a complicated and precarious problem for communities now exposed to an increasingly digital and immaterial world that is unfamiliar. The library is an institution equipped to mediate these borders, by developing work-integrated learning programs as well as learning objects that offer to “bridge” this divide. In the experience of The BRIDGE and the UTSC Library, programming for digital literacy is a vital component to establish borders between digital and physical worlds, as well as to providing educational opportunities to navigating the inclusivity and exclusivity of digital borders in a meaningful way. Showcase 21.2 | Addressing Inequities Critical Digital Pedagogy in Higher Education | Practice Suzan Koseoglu | University of Greenwich George Veletsianos | Royal Roads University Chris Rowell | University of the Arts London Abstract Critical Digital Pedagogy in Higher Education is an edited volume with 13 chapters. The work has recently been published by Athabasca University Press in print, ebook, and open access formats. Contributors to the book critique oppressive educational systems and practices in order to create positive change – these reflections and shared practices reflect the diversity of critical pedagogic practices in the context of digital/digitized higher education. We have divided the chapters in the book according to four prominent themes: shared learning and trust, critical consciousness, change and hope. We invite the delegates to engage in a productive dialogue on these themes and the work in the book through the asynchronous forums. AUPress Description Recent efforts to solve the problems of education—created by neoliberalism in and out of higher education—have centred on the use of technology that promises efficiency, progress tracking, and automation. The editors of this volume argue that using technology in this way reduces learning to a transaction. They ask administrators, instructors, and learning designers to reflect on our relationship with these tools and explore how to cultivate a pedagogy of care in an online environment. With an eye towards identifying different and better possibilities, this collection investigates previously under-examined concepts in the field of digital pedagogy such as shared learning and trust, critical consciousness, change, and hope.

We tackled the problem by creating free online after-school zoom classes for any grade 11-12 students in Ontario. These sessions and additional content were centered around an accessible website. Students participated in three 30 minute sessions; each was equitable and inclusive and involved an important post-secondary topic. Topics include Saving, Borrowing, and Investing. These were taught in an engaging, relatable, and fun manner to increase their retention of the material. We will discuss our ethical social media outreach and teaching methodology. We wanted to share the importance of financial literacy and these three particular topics. As we wished to reduce any barriers that may exist such as socio-economic, political, or racial with a decolonization approach.

Session Link Bring your thoughts for developing ideas and meeting other people with the same interests as you! An Unconference (aka EdCamp) is a user-generated conference. There is no rigid pre-selection of session topics planned in advance. Instead, ideas for collaboration and conversation are determined as attendees identify common themes/topics that they would like to explore, and what they can teach others about. Below is a great video from an in-person EdCamp Victoria that was designed for the K12 sector that explains the concept of an EdCamp well. In this instance, learners and instructors from the Faculty of Education at UVic had the opportunity to mix and share ideas with their field community of K12 teachers and administration. Unconference approaches like this can be applied in any field of study to connect across their discipline (or mixing disciplines) and to mix stakeholder roles in the field (e.g., admin, educators, learners, etc.). This approach is also used in individual classes within a course. See #EdCampUVic on Twitter as a sample and a sample archived EdCamp at UVic. Background on EdCamps “What began as an idea has transformed into a movement. Since the original Edcamp in 2010 there have been over 700 conferences around the world in 25 countries. In the first few months following that first session in Philadelphia, the Edcamp movement grew and flourished in a grassroots manner. Each Edcamp is independently organized and hosted, is free to participants, bringing together passionate educators for a day of learning and growth. The conferences are participant-driven with the sessions developed and facilitated by the teachers who are attending and leverage social media to involve remote attendees. By adopting the unconference protocol inspired by the Barcamp model, Edcamps provide access to high quality, personalized professional learning for all educators. Embracing the belief that fellow educators can be some of the most valuable professional development resources for their colleagues, the Edcamp movement has been recognized by countless organizations, including the United States Department of Education, the Bammy Awards for Education, the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD), the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), the TEDx program and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.” www.edcamp.org How To Participate Watch here for links!!
